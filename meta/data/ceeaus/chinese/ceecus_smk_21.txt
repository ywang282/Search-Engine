 Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion.
   Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you. WhatÅfs moreÅCbeing a decent person in this developing society requires every individual to take the responsibility to the whole community in every occasion. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others.
   Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves.
   Based on those two points I have stressed, IÅfm in favor of the policy: Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.
