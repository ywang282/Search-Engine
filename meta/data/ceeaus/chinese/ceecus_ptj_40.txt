In my eyes, it is not important for collage students to have a part-time job.
   First, we donÅft short of money. No matter wealth or poor, our parents are able to support us to go to university .Also; it is their responsibility to do this. So at this point, we have no reason to make money by ourselves. Having a part-time job, some students only want to buy present for their girlfriends or boyfriends, or just in order to have a new PSP.
   Second, as we know, we are students, we have the severe competition and are admitted to the university which we like, and our aims are to get a good further education. It is also our relatives want us to do. But we waste our time on the part-time job, I think is not worthy. Though a little progress we will make, we are unable to take a big jump in the future. Putting into a lot of energy, the time we used to study is very short.
   Last but not the least important is that we cannot make sure whether it is safe for a part-time job. A lot of newspapers have reported such news as like students are killed because of the part-time job.
