Itfs easily to see the scene that someone who smokes in the public places many years ago. And now we can also see it happens in some restaurants.
I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. To be honest, I hate smoking. It makes the air hardly to breathe and hurt not only the smoker but also the people who are just nearby. It isnft healthy to smoke too much often. Many people who smoke so badly that even get a cancer. 
Can you image a restaurant which is filled with the smoke when you just open the door? Do you want to have a meal at there any more? Itfs easily to see the answers .And if there is a baby who is taken there by his parents, how badly it is. Most women donft like smoke and they also donft like others smoke before them. If you want to have a good impression on them, smoke is the worst choice.
TO ban the smoking is not just be good for the manfs healthy, but also for the environment. We will have a happy time as we are have the healthy air in the restaurants. How nice it is!
