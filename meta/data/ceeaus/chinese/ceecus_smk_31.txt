As we know , smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. smoking affects non-smokers more than it dose smoker. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smoker. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in china. 
Restaurants are also public place. There are many non-smokers. at restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. Smoking can affect customersÅf mind if smokers are around. And smoking do great harm to non-smokers. It is unfair for them. I think it is laughable if there is some one who is smoking at a clean restaurant. Smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous vapour off into the air. the government ban smoking at restaurant  is very necessary and important to us.  It is a measure to protect our health and environment. 
Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places include restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking.
But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us.
