We all know that smoking is harmful to our health. But at the same time somebody also canÅft get themselves out from the unforgettable feelings brought by smoking.
For that I think no smoking is necessary for person. Long time ago, a Chinese who called Lin Zexu raised the first activity of no smoking. Because smoking is not only do harm to our bodies but also poison people's mindsÅCit makes people donÅft want to study, to work, even to play. Maybe nowadays smoking wonÅft cause such phenomenon, but it also do harm to the lungs of people who smoke. Every year a lot of people die of lung disease caused by smoking, and people who smoke also live a shorter life than people who not smoke. 
So that I agree with no smoking. If people smoke less, they will live more happily, and so do their family and friends. Nothing is more important than having a good health.
