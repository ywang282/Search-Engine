I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. In China, there are quite a large number of students cannot afford their tuition. For the reason of attending college and daily life, sometimes they have to find one or more part-time jobs. Of course, there are still large numbers of students have no problem with money. But I think for them, taking a job doesnÅft mean to earn money but to earn more experience. College is just like a small society. Having a part-time job at college can help us enter the society easier. And I think only when we start to make money we realize the difficulty in it. We know for our parents making money is not that easy too. We are adults now and we should act as an adult.
Even though having a part-time job can benefit us a lot, we still should pay attention to it. Firstly, itÅfs important to choose a job fit for us. Say we are now at collage and we canÅft spent all day at the work. WhatÅfs more, we mustnÅft forget our study. Make sure our study is developing smoothly and then we can spent sometime at the job.
I think most collage students may have the experience of taking a part-time job, maybe long or short, maybe one kind or many kinds of. I indeed appreciate my part-time job as a family-teacher. Being a student for so many years, itÅfs cool to sometimes become a teacher!
