In my opinion, thereÅfs no necessary to ban smoking completely. It is known to all that it is not polite and appropriate to smoke in some public occasion. However, it is impossible to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants.
Firstly, China has a long history of growing tobacco, so smoking also last for a long time in China. Smoking become a way of communication when people talk to each other, just as drinking, though both of them are not good to health. People have be accustomed to this way, and can not change the custom in a short time?a few years or tens of years.
Secondly, restaurants are places for people to eat, and to smoke a cigarette after meal is most smokersÅf habit. We can not stop them doing this because that is their freedom. On the other hand, smoking may affect othersÅf health, and that is why many people object smoking at restaurants. At this time, what we could do is to persuade them not to smoke, but we don not have the right to ban them. 
Thirdly, the solution of avoid smoking at restaurants may not be banning, it can be other ways. For example, the public dinning hall can be divided into two parts, one for smokers and the other for non-smokers. In that way, every one can enjoy his dinner.
Anyway, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in China.Å@
