As ChineseÅfs conscious of public manner and healthy problems greatly developed, there has been a general discussion over smoking, one of the questions under debate is whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.

In my point of view, smoking in public is so bad a thing that should not only be banned at restaurants but also all the public places such as hospitals and shopping malls for following reasons.

First and foremost, no one can deny that smoking does harm to peopleÅfs body. According to a recent survey, about four million people die each year from diseases linked to smoking. I have seen a short movie online ? an experiment which shows the extreme horrible results of having been smoked 400 cigarettes. The chemical substance contained in cigarettes can be left in blood vein for many years just like poison. Moreover, when smokers ease their nerves and pressures by smoking, they themselves only breathe in 30% of the tobacco, whereas people nearby breathe in the rest through the second-hand smoking.

Besides, there comes the statistics showing that many of fire accidents occur each year due to the thrown cigarettes ends.

Last but not least, restaurants are places for people to enjoy delicious food , not to bear tobacco. Most female and children canÅft have a comfortable environment while someone are smoking, let along being forced to breathe the unpleasant smell.

In the end ,IÅfm in favor of the discussion of banning smoking at all restaurants in China completely .
