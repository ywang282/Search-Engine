With the process of human's adventure, the cigarette walked into ours life. Smoking has become a habit that being discuss for a long time. As we all know, cigarette contends varies kinds of drugs that do harm to our health, and the man who addicts in smoking has a clear mind on how badly does the cigarette affect people's life. However, there is a discussion held by some people that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in china.
  To my own point of view, I strongly hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the public place. For starters, cigarette does not only do harm to the smoker's body, the smoke when the cigarette burning contends nearly all the poisons that the cigarette has, if you smoke in the public area like restaurant, the smoke would affect other person's health who don't smoke at all! At the same time, the smell of the smoke may make the surrounding clients feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, teenagers do not have a formed standard, they do not have a clear thought on what is good or not. If they thought it is cool smoking outside, they may firm the habit that they could not easily get rid of it since they are children.
  Therefore, I it is necessary for our country to banned smoking in the public like restaurant. And my suggestion is that smoking is a bad habit which do harm to both you and other surrounders, try to get rid of it.
