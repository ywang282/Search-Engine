Doctors suggest that smoking is definitely bad for human health, not only for the people who smoke, but also for someone who is beside them. Smoking has been banned in many places, but I donft think it should be banned at all the restaurants in China.
      That is because I think itfs unnecessary to do so. Actually there is few people smoking in restaurants, and if they want to smoke, they will go outside. Itfs probably because they will feel uneasy if the taste of the dishes become strange or not delicious for their reasons. On the other hand, it is a little unfair to deprive their rights to smoke at all places. Most restaurants have separated rooms today. If people smoke in restaurants, they canft be in a hurry, and if so they would like to choose a separated room rather than to stay in the lobby. So they wonft pollute the whole air of the restaurant. As to the small room where they stay, there is likely someone who fond of smoking like them. It really doesnft matter that much. People who smoke just canft help to smoking sometimes. If we donft allow them to smoke they will feel very uncomfortable. Restaurant is different from any other public places. They can avoid or decrease the time to go to other public places. For example, smoking is banned at railway stations, they can go to the waiting room later so that they need not to smoke before they get on. But no one can avoid going to restaurants. Everybody need to have meals everyday. This kind of restrictions will trouble them a lot.   
    Above all, I donft think itfs necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China.
