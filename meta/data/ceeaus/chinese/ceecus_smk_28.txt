I donft think banning smoking at all the restaurants in China is a good idea.
Itfs no doubt that smoking do harm with our health.The best situation is that no one smokes any more,so smokers and those people around them can have a better life.But absolutely,it can never bu true.Since the fact is there are so many people smoking and canft keep away from it,such tough rule canft work well.We should also think of them.
So in my opinion,the best way is set up smoking areas in the restaurants.Those smokers can smoking only in the areas.And of course,no-smoking areas is more than smoking areas.In this way,most of us can get rid of being affected with smog.Also smoker can have their space to genjoy themselvesh.
I hope maybe this way can reduce the number of smokers a little
