Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? ItÅfs becoming a controversial question recently as more and more college students do part-time job in their spare time.
  Those people, who hold that having a part-time job is essential for college students, emphasize that through part-time jobs, students can learn professional knowledge better. For example, the student who is major in computer takes a part-time job in a computer company, he can learn the knowledge that doesnÅft exist in books and at the same time he can realize thereÅfs still a lot to learn so that he works harder and harder. WhatÅfs more, the part-time job provides them with experiences that canÅft be taught in a lecture hall. They think that the knowledge learn from schools is insufficient. So it is helpful to attend this kind of social life to get social knowledge. It seems that part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. The students who have the experiences in part-time jobs will be more competitive when they find job. Last but not least, the part-time job can offer the students whose families have financial problems enough money so that they can study until graduating from college. 
Others, on the contrary, will of course opposite and, they believe that the most important thing for student is study. They argue that college students are too young to face up with the complex society and itÅfs also a waste of time.
According to me, the benefits will certainly outdo the drawbacks. However, it depends on you .If you can deal the relationship between working and learning well, IÅfm sure that you can succeed in the end.
