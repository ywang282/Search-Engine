As far as a qualified modern college student is concerned, I approve of the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part time job. From my point of view, it can not only relief our parentsÅf burden but also enable us to make good preparation for our social life in the future.
It is well known that the campus is called Ågivory towerÅh, and it is also very obvious that students should pay most of their attention on their professional knowledge. But on the other hand, college students in modern time should also have a good knowledge of the world outside. And a part-time job is just a good chance to contact the society and learn more practical things that canÅft be learned at school.
For example, as for me, I am doing a part time job as a private teacher. I think it can offer me some money to do whatever I want without ask my mother. And whatÅfs more important is that through the part-time job, I have learned how to balance my study and other things batter. I also learned how to get well with different kinds of people. I also did other kinds of part-time before.        I learned much from my experience and these are all prepare for my future work. 
There is no doubt that a part-time job can offer us the chance to know the world outside better which may awaken in us a high sense of duty and help us make greater achievement in the future. Therefore, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.
