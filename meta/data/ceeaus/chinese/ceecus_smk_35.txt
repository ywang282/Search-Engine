I must say smoking in the restaurant is very impolite.Å@It may destroy other's appetite and do harm to the health of others.
  As a non-smoke person, I hate the smoke which is made by smokers in every place at every time. So if someone advice banning smoking at restaurant, I will put up two hands to show my agreement. And I believe that it will must be banned someday.
  However, as a big country with a large amount of smokers, banning all of them smoking in the restaurant is not easy. Most of them will be against it and may say that it harms their rights. The host of the restaurant will hate the rule more than the smokers, because it will have a bad effect on their making money. The unwillingness of the most important two roles--the smokers and host will delay the process of banning the smokers smoke in the restaurant and become a big problem when the government perform the rule.
  But the rule that banning smokers smoke in the restaurant is good to the majority and have much more supporters. What's more, it have to do with a nation's image. So the government should ban smoking in restaurant to meet the most people's requirement.
