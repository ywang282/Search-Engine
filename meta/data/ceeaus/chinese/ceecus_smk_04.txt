More and more people pick up smoking nowadays. People smoke for different reasons. Most of them smoke because of fierce competition. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China.
As is known to all, smoking is really dangerous. It is toxic and does harm to peopleÅfs lung damagingly. It not only does harm to those who smoke but also does harm to people surrounding. Moreover, people who smoke will be addicted to it gradually and it is really difficult to drop the habit. If people smoke at the restaurants, we will not have a good atmosphere to have meals. We can not imagine how scary it would be that the air would not be clear any longer but full of smoke. We will feel that the food would not be tasty any more. That would only lead to cough. Thus, in order to have a better environment for the public, there should be no smoking at the restaurants.
  To sum up, smoking is of no use. Those who are addicted to it would better kick it out as soon as possible just for you and for the public.
