Although some people hold the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, others opposite it.
  The people who support that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China think that smoking is not only bad for the smokerÅfs own health, but also has bad influence on other peopleÅfs health. Secondhand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban smoking. Banning smoking in the restaurants is very good news for non-smokers, so that they can go out of restaurants and return home without nasty smelling. WhatÅfs more, smoking kills thousands of people and this is the best way to discourage people from smoking.
  Others, however, look at this question in a totally different way and they hold that itÅfs unnecessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. First of all, everyone has the right to decide whether smoke or not, some people believe that smoking can make them feel relax. Furthermore, the taxation of the cigarette contributes a lot to the National finance income. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants in China, a large number of people will lose job. At the same time, the customer of the restaurants will definitely reduce.
  As far as IÅfm concerned, smoking brings serious health consequence, and the pollution to other people's atmospheres also makes it an environmental issue. But I also think that people have the right to choose whether smoke or not. On the other handÅCitÅfs undeniable that selling cigarettes bring huge profits to our country and the people whose work related to it. So the best way to deal with this problem is to have the smoking area and non-smoking area in all the restaurants instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants.
