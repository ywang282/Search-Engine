We all know that itfs harmful for people to smoke whether in his 20s or his 50s.@It seems that smokers are becoming younger and the number larger.@And people pay more attention to smoking.@But I donft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China and itfs impossible to do that too.@There may be some people are strongly against smoking and they just canft stand the smell.@We can just open up some restaurants that ban smoking or make a part of the restaurants named no-smoking areas.
    When we entire the society,@smoking is not just a form of entertainment, but a way of communication. Of course, smoking a lot is absolutely not allowed. Ifm non-smoker and I donft know how beautiful the cigarette is that so many people are addicted to it. I donft want to smoke in the future either. Since smoking canft be banned at once we should make up our mind to do something. Not to ban it at all the restaurants but to let people know how harmful it is. And let more and more people experience the happiness of clear air and clear mouth. At that time we neednft to ban it and people just donft want to smoke neither in the restaurants nor somewhere else.
