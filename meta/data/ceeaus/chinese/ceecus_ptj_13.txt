As far as I am concerned, it is important for student to have a part-time job. My points are listed as follows.
Firstly ,students in the school take classes in the campus everyday, so that they concentrate too much on the books in front of them ,leading to a fact that they do not know much about the society, which is by all means not good for them esp when they step into society .Having a part-time job help them to learn to work in a earlier time, to get along with people who have been working for some period of time and so on, all of which give them a closer view to society ,which is certainly a kind of good experience for them .
Secondly, doing a part-time job make students have different points of views as they should deal with people from all walks of life .This can also gives them different respects to value things .
Thirdly, they know better how to earn money and have a deeper understanding of how their parents brought them up, which also let them treasure the present life.
So, it is important for student to have a part-time job.
