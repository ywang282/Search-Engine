Nowadays, more and more students are doing part-time work. But different people hold different opinion .I think students working part time usually have a positive effect on them. For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. It enables him to be independent and builds up his self-confidence. WhatÅfs more, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to get along with different kinds of people ,get useful working experiences and learn the value of labor. Besides earning some money to support themselves, they can learn a lot which cannot be learned from textbooks.
As everything has two sides, the disadvantages can't be ignored. Part-time jobs cut into students' study time; some even become so occupied with making money that they canÅft focus their attention on studying. In the end, these students may fall behind or fail in their studies. 
      In my opinion, students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation. The most important thing is for him to keep a good balance.
