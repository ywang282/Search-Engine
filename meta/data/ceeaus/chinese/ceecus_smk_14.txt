I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at any restaurant in china.
Firstly, in terms of health, as is widely known to everybody, smoking is definitely very harmful to peoplefs health. And what is worse, people who are around smokers will get second-hand smoking which does even more serious damage to health than the smoker himself. I suppose we can put it as g harm set, harm get h. It is quite easy to imagine a picture that in a restaurant, which is quite limited space, customers are talking and eating happily, however, several smokers make the restaurant foggy here and there, and while the other customers are enjoying themselves, unconsciously, inhaling victim smoker all the time and very likely to be suffocated by the dirty air. Especially when children is in this restaurant, I can hardly imagine what effect will it do year by year, but no doubt, things will turn out terrible.
Whatfs more, if the smoker uncarefully drops the cigarette on the carpet or doesnft stub the cigarette out completely, it will quite probably cause an accidental fire, which is apparently a very dangerous thing.
From my point of view, smoking is really troublesome and has potential risks. I advocate that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in china.
