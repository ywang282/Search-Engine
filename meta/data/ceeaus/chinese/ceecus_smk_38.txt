 I totally support the statement.
   Smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to the people around, not to say in the restaurants. No one has the right to harm others. But as we know some people canÅft help smoking in the restaurants, so government should do something to ban it.
   What is restaurant? Restaurant is not only the place we have lunch and dinner, it is also the place we have rest and lighten ourselves. Imagine that you are in a restaurant which is full of smoke, what you want to do now? The first thing I will do is run away from the lousy place. 
In fact, I think it is very rude to smoke in the restaurant. I the restaurant, we often meet some foreigners. No matter what we say or what we do represent our country, our China. The famous newspaper <<New York Times >> has said that china is the most civilized ancient country in the world. But in the daily life, what we Chinese do not show this. Smoking in the restaurants will let the foreigners feel down about us.
 Also, if the restaurants are small, smoking will easily cause a fire.
As for the reasons above, smoking should be banned in all of chinaÅfs restaurants.
