I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Restaurant is the place for us to have meals and relax. Itfs really hard for a man who never smoke to stand a people nearby smoke during meals. 
Most of us wonft like a restaurant with strange smell, but itfs hard for them to clean up the smell, and provide the next consumer with a clean environment to have meals.
As all of us know, smoking is harmful to our health, which is banned in most of the public place, but why it canft be banned in the restaurants? This is because the managers of the restaurants afraid that they will lose many consumers if other restaurants donft do the same thing. Their fears come from that most of the people go to the restaurants are adults, and in China, many of the men smoke when they grow up. If they ban it, it means keep lots of people out of the door, but they should also think that if smoking is allowed in the restaurants, they will lose many consumers who hate smoking, too.
I think, the one who should take measures is our country, not the restaurants. Like the plastic bags, its just a small case. Itfs the best way, I think.
