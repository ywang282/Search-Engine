I donÅft think so.To find a part-time job maybe helpful, howere, honestly speaking it is not helpful to many college students .
First of all,taking part-time jobs may take much of our time which should have been used in study.To most of we students the most important thing is getting as much knowledge as possible before graduating .What an employer wants is the knowledge you have not how much you have earned in your part-time job.
Second,in grade 4,colleges will provide us opportunities to take practice.We can learn experienses, money and all we need to prepare at that time.At that time we will be better prepared than before.
Third,since we live in such a country that have a huge number of people,the amount of the work that is able to do is limited.If we all want to get a part-time job then how many chances will leave those who really need a job to survive. What can those people do? Then what will our country be like?
In conclusion,I think it unnecessary for a college students to find a part-time job.It is not helpful for himself and also not good to other people, further more not good to the society. It is better to do the right thing at the right time.
