 I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. 
  As long as the Olympic Games was being holden in Beijing , smoking has been completely banned at all the restaurants in China. It is a truth that we all know that it is harmful for us if we smoke. And it is not only harmful for who smokes, it is also harmful for the people who are around the smoker. We go to restaurants to have dinner, not be like to let ourselves to be controlled in the harm of second smoking. Everyone have the right to let himself be in a good environment to enjoy dinner. 
  As we all know, such as England and France, many countries have been published the law that smoking should be banned in public place. I think the banned of smoking is one of a typical of the degree of a countryÅfs development. China is fast developing now, every one should have a good behave in the public place. As long as we know it is harmful to everyone if someone smokes in a public place, it is good to be completely banned in restaurants.
