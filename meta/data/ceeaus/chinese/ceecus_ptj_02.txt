With the development of the living conditions and qualities, quite more and more students have the opportunity to go to college .Parents and the public are concerned with college studentsÅf development .A great many people start to pay more attention on part-time job. Some people hold the view that part-time jobs will affect studentsÅf study in college. In my opinion, a part-time job can help a lot.
First of all, knowledge should be put into proactive. Through a part-time job, we can better understand what we have learned in college. Also, we can gain much more than what we have learned from books. Moreover a part-time job is a bridge which connects the college period and the career period after graduation. Some students will feel to have no direction when they graduate of they have never had part-time jobs in college. Since fierce competition is waiting for them, they have little time to adjust to the new environment. IT is not easy for then to learn how companies and working. Yet,Å@if they once had part-time jobs. They will better get involved in the jobs they do. Last but not least, a part-time job can help one build up social relationship and will make one feel more confident. 
The modern society needs talents that develop in all directions. 
What we learn from textbooks is far less than enough. A part-time job will make up our disadvantages effectively.
