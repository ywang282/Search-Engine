Yes, I think so. Since we are now college students, it means not only studying hard, but also ÅgworkingÅh hard. After graduating from the college, we are to step into the society. If we donÅft have any experience about how to work well, how can we live on? Having a part-time job just means getting more experience about the job and the society. At the same time, we can make money for our everyday life, and save money from our parents. That will make our parents happy. 
As is known for all, having a part-time job requires us to balance study and part-time job well. That can practice our management skill of time. Saving more time means living longer. If we can manage our time well, we can have a much more efficient life. 
Moreover, we can practice our communication skill. Nowadays, the level of communication skill leads to the level of your success. If we can communicate with others well, we can make many friends, and they can help us when needed. With the help from our friends, we can succeed more easily than on our own. 
So, I agree with college students having a part-time job.
