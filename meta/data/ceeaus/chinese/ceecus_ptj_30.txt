I think it is important for a college-student to support a part-time job. Maybe someone will say Ågyou must do what student should to do, as a student, the only work you need to you is to study.Åh

But I think this opinion is not completely right, why? As a college-student, we have already been adults, we have the ability to keep ourselves, although we need to study, we donÅft have so much time for part-time job , but little is forever better than nothing . We can do some simple part-time jobs, although the salary is too poor to keep our life, with this money we can reduce pressure of our parents. And the most important reason is the part-time job can make us to know the society, nowadays collage-students have few chances to know the society , when they graduate from collage and enter in the society , they will feel anxious . Part-time job can make you know how to live in the society, and let you know how to make communications with other people. these are very important for us to live in the society.

  Take a little time, and get you much advantage, go to search for a part-time job.
