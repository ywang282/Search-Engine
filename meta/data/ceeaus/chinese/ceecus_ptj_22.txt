 This is a discussion about if it is right for college students to have a part-time job. Some students think that it is important for us have the chance to have a part-time job to broaden our view. However, there is still some students think that it is no need for us using time and energy to have a part-time job.
 In my opinion, I think that it is very important for us college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, having a part-time job can help us make good use of our time. Because most of us use our time on playing computer games or playing with friends after class. Secondly ,having a part-time job can give us more experience. It will make us college students more confident and mature for future . Besides, having a part-time also can make some money, can't it ? We can use the money we make buy some things we need. For example , the professional books or tools . What's more, we can live easier with the money.
 In one word, I agree with the students who think that it is important for college students to have a part-time . And it is the time for us to take a action!
