AGREE. I am quite with this statement. I donÅft want to talk about whether it is good or not to smoke . the result is so clear. And I can understand why so many people still keep smoking will themselves know ÅhSMOKING IS BAD TO HEALTHÅh clearly. ItÅfs their habit. 
  But smoking in public should be banned . public place is a place where everyday a mess of people gather at including children women with babies and old people. Smoking is a habit of who is smoking ,but these guys have no rights to do harm to the people without the bad habit.
  So I am agree with the statement.  
  Maybe someone think itÅfs much better to divide the restaurants into two part ÅgSMOKING ALLOWED Åg ones and ÅgSMOKING BANNEDÅh ones.  But I donÅft think so. for the fact that it is clear that smoking is bad to our health.  So  we should try to get everyone  out  of  the bad habit, and making every restaurants and even every public places no-smoking is also a great way by making smokers fell that they are not accepted by the others with the bad habit, and I believe that between smoking and being accept by public ,most people will choose the last one.
