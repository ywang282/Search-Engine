When it comes to college studentsÅf part-time jobs, people will hold different opinions on it. Although some people believe it is not necessary for college students to do part-time jobs, I think it helpful for us.
There are some factors supporting my point. Doing part-time job is what can improve our ability including working ability and living ability. Besides, in this way we can step on the society earlier, touch different people and experience different things, which is contributed to open and enlarge our field and vision. In addition ,we can also earn money which allows us to do what we want.
However, there are also some disadvantages in it. For example , it will take a lot of time which should be spent on study. So we must deal with the part-time job and the studyÅfs relation. WhatÅfs worse, we also may be taken in by some evildoers. So it is necessary for us to improve our alert. If We can do as this, we will gain many meaningful things from it
Taking into account all these features, I believe deep that it is important for us colleges to do part-time job.
