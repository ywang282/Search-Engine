In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
If the college student can take the full use of the part time job, it can not only bring the salary but also can provide the chance of prove our social experience. College students are different from the high school or junior students. The aim we study in the college is to have a job, but not for enter the university as before. Social life has its own rule which is very different from the school, it is more complicate, more danger. So if we have no experience we will fell very puzzling when we graduated from university.
Some people disagree with the idea who said that college students are easy to be tricked. But I think it is much better than be tricked when you graduated. On the other hand, be tricked is also an important course we have to learn before we enter the social, which is canÅft be learned from the courses we take in the school, but only can learn from the practice.
Of course, all we talked is based on that your part time will not influence your normal studying. If you spend most time on part time job which make you canÅft educated, than except the money ,you can get nothing from the part time job and it just lost itÅfs real meaning. Balance is important for everything.
