      I think the first professional is knowledge, social jobs and skills are the second point.
     We are STUDENTS, not workers or so on. To have a good job, first of all, we should have good structure of the knowledge.
      Students must have the basic skills of learning, so that we can plan our own future for our lives better .To take full advantage of opportunity, college students should study hard instead of working. Only to learn can we meet the greater challenges.
      A famous philosopher once said: Giving fishing skills to someone is far more better than giving fish to him. Working in college can just earn money, but if you study well, you can earn more and more.
    That is my opinion of this subject.
