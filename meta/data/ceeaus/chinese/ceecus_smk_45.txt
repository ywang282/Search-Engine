Now more and more people are smoking, especially in some public places, such as restaurant. So smoking is becoming a problem for us.
   As we all know, smoking is bad for our health, our organ?lungs. But since the cigarette has been as a kind of social customs which widely used in our society, the ÅgNo SmokingÅh seems to be difficult.
   In my opinion, I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant. The first reason, smoking will lead to the disaster?fire. When people go to the restaurant, they enjoy themselves very much, so that they may forget the consciousness of fire prevention. Especially when some men drink a lot and become unconscious, some accident will happen. ItÅfs terrible, and the consequence is unimagined. The second, I think the smoking is worse for the other people around the smokers. It is said that smoking indirectly is worse for health than smoking directly. The third, cigarette not only costs money but also ruins our body. I canÅft find any advantages from it. Last, if someone is addicted to it, he canÅft drop it easily.
