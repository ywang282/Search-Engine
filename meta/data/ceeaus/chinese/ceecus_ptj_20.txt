 When I was a high school student, I was always dreaming about my colorful college life. In my eyes, college students should make the best use of the time to experience different things. Of course, I cannot miss part-time job. 
I do believe that we can benefit from doing a part-time job and my opinion is based on the following reasons.
 Firstly, it is said that the campuses are much purer than the society and we college students lack society experience. According to this fact, the most important point of part-time job is gaining experience so that we can get ourselves prepared for the jobs in the future. 
    Besides, we learn to how to deal with others through doing part-time jobs. We will be aware of customsÅf need and learn to use what we have learnt to fulfillment their requirement.
 The last but not the most least is that we can earn some pocket money to buy something we are longing for, to give our parents a surprise that we are no longer children. WhatÅfs more, as earning money is no easy, we will realize the importance of money and learn to use money more correctly.
Do a part-time job to larger our vision, to improve ourselves, to make our college life more colorful.
