 From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job.
  College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can`t learn such skills in the textbooks in the university.
  I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us.
  Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial.
  But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can`t balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your studyÅBAfter all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job.
