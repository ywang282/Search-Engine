 I agree with the statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. Because I myself am one of the sufferers.
  As we all know, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker but also the others around. So we have no-smoking coach on the train and no-smoking cabin on the plane. Why not the restaurants?
  Someone maybe say gYes, we have the no-smoking restaurants. Donft like the smoke? Please go there. It is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants. h In my opinion, nobody has the right to harm other peoplefs health, but the law has the power to protect everyonefs health. If you would like to smoke, please smoke outside or back to home, donft disturb others. 
Thatfs why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.
