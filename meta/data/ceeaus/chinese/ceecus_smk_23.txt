In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China.
Firstly, smoking is bad for our body, because it can damage many organs. It is known that many of people get ill because of it, and some of the diseases even cannot be cured , as a result ,what is waiting for them is death.
Secondly, smoking is not only bad for smokers but for people around them. Scientists have shown that the most serious victims are people around you when you smoking ,because the most polluted air is smoked by them not you .Maybe many of people are surprise at the fact and cannot believe it ,but it is the truth.
Thirdly, if we have realized the badness of smoking and have decided to ban smoking , the government should do a favour so that restaurants all over the country can ban it together .The reason is that if only a few restaurants did it , people who like smoking will think that it were strange or unfair. As a result, they may choose another restaurant that does not ban it , instead. After a long time , banning smoking restaurants may give up , because their customs are decreasing , and what they have done is in vain .
In a word , smoking is bad for not only you but me . It is better to ban it not only in restaurants but in anywhere.
