 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Not for the payment, but the experience which we get from the work.
  As a college student, though we learn a lot in class and take part in kinds of activities, the knowledge for working is far from enough. We even donÅft know copy the documents or make a schedule for others. Someone even donÅft have a consciousness of time ? no matter how the meeting is important, they are always late. 
  We hope to train ourselves, and of course, the companies also want the college students to have more ability. So if one has an experience just like a part-time job while studying, he/she will get a dominant position in the job-searching.
  Somebody maybe say ÅgOK! We will train ourselves in the Student Union. ItÅfs a good place for learning and working.Åh I donÅft think so. Although we can learn a lot in the Student Union, for example, to write a program for the sports-meeting, the Student Union is not a company or the society. You are working, but with your classmates and in the campus.
  These are the reasons why I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
