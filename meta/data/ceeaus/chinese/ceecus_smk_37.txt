I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in China. First, I want to say, one kind functions of smoking is relaxing oneself. And for a lot of restaurants in China, the slogan is Ågcustomer is the God, we will do whatever to fill GodÅfs needs.Åh So if their God want to relax himself by smoking, how can they stop him?
Then, we have to face a reality, that in China, especially for Chinese businessmen, cigarette and wine are the most common way to make their relations closer, which means that they are helpful to their cooperation. How such a useful way should be banned? Maybe in one way, it can influent our economy development.
 I think the reason why people want to ban smoking at the restaurant is it make the air terrible. In fact, many restaurants have thought about it, they set the non-smoking rooms and smoking rooms, which is really convenient for all the people.
  Everyone has his right to enjoy himself at the restaurants, so itÅfs really not a good rule to ban people to smoke.
