I donft think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in China. In my opinion, when we want to do something, first we should plan it and then do it step by step. The present situation of Chinese restaurant is that these even no smoking area or smoking banned area. And on the other hand, it doesnft necessary to banned smoking at all the restaurant if there has smoking section and smoking banned section.
And chinafs population is so large that among them the smoking people is not a small number. The amount of restaurant in china is unimagined. To ban smoking at all the restaurant is a real risk.
