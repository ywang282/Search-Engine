As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China .
Smoking produces bad smell .If smoking is allowed in the restaurants ,guests would feel disgusting and the wall in the room is easy to become yellowish ,which is bound to have a bad effect on the business because almost all the customers esp. the would prefer the non-smoking places to have a meal instead of where smoking smell are filled .
Some may hold the view that the banning may be makes some people reluctant to enter the restaurants ,but I donÅft think it is true .Customers would not refuse to keep themselves from smoking just for so short time ,no one must smoke during their mealtime .
Moreover, statistics show that majority of the customers say that they would come to have a meal as usual .And take the airports and the cinema for example, where smoking has been banned for more than 10 years, the number of the passengers wasnÅft declined due to the policy at all .On the contrary, some restaurants become more popular with customers after the banning has started .
Ireland has already put this policy into use since 2004 throughout the whole country, followed by so many European countries, and British even use the strict punishment to make smoking banned, all which tells us that smoking are sincerely regarded to be unhealthy and the banning throughout the country is becoming a unavoidable trend .So why donÅft China follow the trend which could absolutely benefit us in the long run? Some countries even rule that smoking is only allowed in peopleÅfs home .
All in all, I suppose smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China.
