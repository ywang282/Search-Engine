In my opinion, the part-time job is beneficial to a college student. Doing part-time job, they can earn money by themselves, know more about the difficulties of making money, gain some experience and become more independent.
  While there are some problems. The first problem is time. As students of Japanese department, most of us get up at six, in order to read Japanese text and then study till midnight every day, even on Saturday and Sunday. So up to now, only two students take a part-time job in our class.
  Though the part-time job is beneficial, the role it plays in our campus life is not very important. I even can't feel my sister's change after she did the part-time job when she was a college student. And now she is more pleased to see that I pay more attention to the Japanese and English than doing a part-time job. If someone want to lighten the economic burden by doing part-time jobs, it needs a lot of time .Because a little work doesn't work. Maybe work hard for the scholarship is more efficient.
  Do you think my view is opposite to the first one? I just want to say in the theory, the part-time job is beneficial; in the fact, it doesn't make much difference and needs time.
  For myself, If I won't be so busy in the second or third year in the college, I am glad to do a part-time job, but not must to.
