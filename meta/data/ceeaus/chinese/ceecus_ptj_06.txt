It is an interesting topic for us to discuss, and it is necessary for us to consider if we should do something in our spare time. 
As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below.
First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now.  So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice. 
Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we donÅft have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full.
At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life.
In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job.
