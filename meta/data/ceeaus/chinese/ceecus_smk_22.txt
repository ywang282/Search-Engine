 I donÅft quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think. 
  Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who donÅft smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money. 
  As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we canÅft force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who donÅft smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. ThatÅfs my opinion.
