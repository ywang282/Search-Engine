When we come to the college, almost every new student will be into the situation. Should our students to have a part-time job?
In my opinion, itÅfs necessary to have a part-time job. Most of the students havenÅft ever leave home before entered the college. It seems that we are always in the protection of our parents. Therefore, we need to see and know the world by our own eyes. Having a part-time job can make us to attach the real world and society. It likes my father said, life is like a school. To be a student, we should not only learn knowledge form the text books but also from the life. Life is always your best teacher. WhatÅfs more, from the part-time job we also learn that itÅfs not so easy to earn money as we think. Mostly, whatÅfs we paid would be more than we earn. And if you want to be going further than others, you should arm yourselves better than others. That means you should know more and learn more. Within the job we increase our experiences as well. For example, what should we do when facing the emergency? How to do a work better? And I believe that it will be a warmly memory when we look back whenever it is.
