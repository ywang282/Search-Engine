At recently, there is a heated view whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. With the development of the society, Smoking has became a world problem. there are more and more people to smoke. Many people think pressure of family, work, life lead to smoke. Though smoker have many reasons to smoke. they think smoking is own thing.
But in my opinion ,Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. On the one hand, Smoking will be effect peopleÅfs health and life. People will have a bad effects. Some people start to smoke when they are young. When they stop to smoke they feel terrible. They will feel headache. Whatever they do, they donÅft have no action. On the other hand, when you smoke in restaurants, you will be effect other peopleÅfs  health. It have worse effects. it will destroy restaurants environment. And non-smoker will be terrible. So smoker effect another .They maybe do not find their action will hurt anther people.
Though analysis of above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The government could make law to forbid smoking in restaurants. And it warn smoking will effect yourself and another peopleÅfs health. It will many good aspects to life. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.
