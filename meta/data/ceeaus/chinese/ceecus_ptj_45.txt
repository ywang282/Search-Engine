I agree with the statement that itÅfs important for college students to have a part-time job. 
First of all, in modern society, college students are facing bigger and bigger pressure on job hurting. Almost all the companies are tending to employ staffs with working experiences even for the new graduates. In order to find a job, college students need working experiences. During college, students are old enough to be hired; college study is not as busy as lower level education, too. This is really a good time to start working. 
Meanwhile, college students get paid by part-time jobs; this will also lighten the financial pressure from the parents.  With the income students can spend more money on there interests, which may have positive effects to their lives. 
At last, there must be a lot of differs between campus life and society. By part-time jobs, students will learn how to communicate with different people, how to face failure and challenges, which can never be taught in campuses. Students with part-time jobs will know the society earlier and better. This will make them brave, responsible and grown-up. 
So I think itÅfs very important for college students to have a part-time job. And I hope the society and companies will provide more part-time positions.
