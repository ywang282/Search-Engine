I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
First,college is a place not only for us to learn our major,but also a place to learn how to make a life in the future.The experance of working is very important.Because it can let us know how to deal with kinds of troubles when we step into the society.
Second,to have a part job means we can earn some money.Though it is not a large income,we can know the hardness to earn money.I suppose that many of the Chinese college stuents spent too much money on unnesscery things, just because they get money only from their parents.
But in my opinion,not all the part-time job are fit for us.If we choose the job which take us too mach time,it will do bad to our studies.The most important thing for our college students,as all know,is studies.So I preffer the job take me two or three times a week,and every time one or two hours.
Every coin has two sides.What we should do is to find a balance between studies and part-time job.
