   I believe it is a bad idea for college students to have part-time jobs. There are two reasons why I believe this.
   The first reason is college students have many responsibilities just as students. Attending classes, doing homework, writing essays and reports are just some of the demands that they have to meet. Having a part-time job on the side takes away the studentÅfs time to focus on what they should be doing which is studying. This can lead to less study time, because the time the student would normally use to study would be taken up by the time needed at the part-time job. This could, in turn, lead to lack of sleep essential for learning, since he or she would have to make up the time to study later when they should actually be sleeping.
   Along with studying, what is also important is participation in clubs since many of the clubs in college are career-oriented. By choosing the club that is related to their major, they can get the experience they need later in their field when they graduate and get a job in that field of study. All clubs have secretary, manager, and treasurer positions found in many jobs as well. Taking the manager position, for instance, will give them the leadership skills they would need later if they plan to become a manager of a company or a branch. Working as a treasurer, gives them experience working with money as well as experience planning their clubÅfs budget for the year. 
    IÅfd like to conclude by saying that rather than getting part-time jobs outside of college, students should focus on their lives inside college by joining clubs and concentrating on their studies.
