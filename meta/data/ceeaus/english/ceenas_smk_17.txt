There is no doubt in my mind that smoking should be banned entirely in all restaurants in Japan.  Honestly, I almost find it difficult that people are still asking this question because the hazards of cigarette smoke have been well known for many years, not only by consumers and doctors, but most especially, the tobacco companies themselves.  The toxicity of second-hand tobacco smoke is said to be almost as high as a carÅfs exhaust.  Is it reasonable to ask people to eat their breakfast, lunch or dinner in a parking garage with a car revving its engine?  Of course not, and it should be very much the same with restaurants not allowing their paying customers to be subjected to the equally toxic and stinky fumes from cigarettes.  
	Certainly I recognize that smokers will feel bad about not being able to enjoy a cigarette while dining out with friends, but I also donÅft see how any reasonable person can try to compare a smokerÅfs Åghurt feelingsÅh with the clinically verifiable hazards associated with second-hand tobacco smoke.  Since it is absolutely ridiculous to equate a smoker feeling discriminated against, with their imposing a statistically quantifiable increase in a number of health problems upon other non-smoking patrons, smoking patrons and of course, the staff, I will pull no punches when I say, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan!
