All college students should have a part-time job. There are many excellent reasons to join the work force while still attending school. For some students, the extra money will assist them in obtaining needed books and materials for study. Others will benefit from the discipline and time-management skills gained in balancing a study schedule with a semi-regular work regimen. Students who spend time away from the oppressive, thought-controlling atmosphere of most large universities will meet people accustomed to living and thinking in freedom. It can come as a welcome shock to the cloistered student to learn such a fascinating world exists, where the recommended norms of contemporary university thought patterns not only do not apply, they are mocked as absurd. 
As well, occupying oneself with an outside activity such as work restricts the amount of time available to fall in with bad company or develop social habits deleterious to academic achievement. Said activities include extended periods of video game playing during school hours, lounging on oneÅfs sofa watching daytime television, indulging in repeated bouts of binge drinking with equally dissolute friends, and an obsessive devotion to online fleshpots promising sexual release in exchange for money. The individual whose day is split between class and workplace has no opportunity to sample temptation. It therefore behooves all students to arrange for part-time employment as soon as possible. The alternative does not bear mentioning.
