I agree with this opinion. I have three opinions.
First, a part-time job in their field of study would be beneficial. Students would be able to gain hands on experience in the industry. This experience can contribute student opinions outside of the textbook. Working in the industry could help determine if the student selected the appropriate field. All study programs do not offer internships where students have the opportunity to obtain hands on experience. Therefore,  seeking a part-time job related to their studies could be very rewarding. Second, many students are unsure and undecided of their future. The opportunity to experience working in their field of study could be quite helpful in choosing the direction of their future. A part-time job in an unrelated field of study could discover new interests and offer more options for a brighter future. Third, an appropriate part-time job could inspire students to excel in their current field of studies. Most students are not diligent until their senior years. Work experience could offer a point of view from the real world which is often difficult to comprehend from a textbook. Based on the above reasons, I support the opinion. This is to encourage students to not waste time in discovering the direction of their future.
