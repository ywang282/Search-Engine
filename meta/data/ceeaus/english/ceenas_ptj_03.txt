    I agree with the statement that college students should have part-time jobs. There are two reasons for this.
    The first reason is the money issue. Many college students complain that they donÅft have enough money to spend even on food at times. Having a part-time job gives students that extra money they may need in such an emergency. Saving the money earned through work a little at a time is also a good idea. The alternative is asking others, like parents or friends, for money. However, doing so again and again may put some strains on the relationships with the people you borrowed from. They may eventually see you as a ÅevampireÅf. This is especially true with friends. College students need to show that theyÅfre putting the effort into keeping themselves financially stable. People are more willing to help when you need money, if they see that you are trying to do something on your part to earn money.
    The other reason for having a part-time job while in college is work experience. Of course, having a part-time job that is related to your major is an advantage. For example, if your major is teaching and you take a part-time job tutoring high school students, you will have a chance to put into use some of the theories and practices you learned in the classes you are taking. By doing this, youÅfll know what works well and what doesnÅft. Having a part-time job unrelated to your major could also benefit you by expanding your horizons thus increasing your job opportunities after college.
    In conclusion, I encourage all students to take part-time jobs because it is a good opportunity for them to do something productive not only for their present situations but also their futures.
