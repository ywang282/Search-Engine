There are three reasons why smoking should be allowed in restaurants and bars.
    The first reason is the atmosphere of the restaurant. Many people go to bars and restaurants to have fun, relax. For a lot of people, smoking is one of the ways they can do this. By banning smoking, smokers wouldnÅft be able to enjoy being in the restaurant. They would have to leave every once in a while to smoke. I believe that smokers would be less inclined to go to bars and restaurants. This would lead to the second reason being business.
    Many, I would say half, of the customers who go to restaurants are smokers. By banning smoking, the restaurant would in effect be cutting out half of their business. This would mean less money coming in which would then lead to lower wages for the workers there. The consequence of lowering the workerÅfs pay would be lower morale. The workers would be less inclined to create great meals.
The third reason is that restaurants do not have to resort to pushing away smokers. They can easily accommodate smokers as well as non-smokers. In fact, many restaurants have done this by splitting the restaurant into a smoking and a non-smoking section. In the US, this is very common and may be so in other countries. This is a win-win situation. Non-smokers can feel comfortable smoking and non-smokers can enjoy a smoke-free environment. Restaurants would profit as well by welcoming all people to come and enjoy, regardless of whether they smoke or not.
In conclusion, I think that banning smoking in restaurants would be a very bad idea. It is not the question of whether we should accommodate smokers or not, but rather a question of how we should accommodate them.
