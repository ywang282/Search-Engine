The topic of banning smoking in restaurants in Japan is a controversial one. However, I believe it is a necessary step in order to protect the rights of all those living in Japan, as well as relieving an unnecessary financial burden from the shoulders of Japanese tax payers.
	It is a proven fact that smoking is harmful to oneÅfs health whether they are smokers themselves or just happen to be in the close vicinity of smokers. Second hand smoke is damaging and potentially deadly to those who are exposed to it. It can thus be considered an act of harmful negligence for one to smoke in the presence of others. It is because of this that the government must take appropriate measures to insure the safety of all by protecting them from second hand smoke in public venues.
	In Japan the financial health burdens of one are shared partially by the many by way of the national health care system. However, when it comes to health problems that are caused directly or indirectly by smoking it becomes a question of responsibility.  This is a luxury the common tax payer and the federal government cannot afford nor should they be made to. Smokers who continue to smoke despite adequate public knowledge of the risks should be made to foot the bill for their health care. By banning public smoking in places such as restaurants the government is sending a message that smoking is no longer socially acceptable and should help encourage smokers to quit.
	In conclusion banning public smoking is a necessary step not only to protect the right to venture out risk free in public of its citizens, but also to discourage smoking and therefore also protect their wallets.
