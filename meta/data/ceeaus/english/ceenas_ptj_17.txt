I believe it is very important for college students to get a part-time job.  First of all, during oneÅfs college years, the transition from being a dependent child to an independent adult is rapidly underway.  Quite often, the students have moved away from home and must take responsibility for many aspects of their lives, ranging from getting up and going to bed, to making sure their homework is completed on time.  And for those living outside of university dormitories, preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner is also entirely up to them.  And, even if the students are still living with their parents while in college, they never-the-less are trying to build an identity for themselves and taking on many of the responsibilities IÅfve mentioned.
	I admit this may seem like a lot to handle for a person in their late teens or early twenties.  And I also understand that adding a part-time job on top of all of this may appear to provide an unnecessary burden, but the contrary is true.  By adding a job to the aforementioned list of responsibilities, the students gain the added benefit of remuneration.  As such, the personal satisfaction of gaining financial independence in life is enormous, and the added self-esteem can manifest itself in improved performance in school and a growing sense of securing their place in the world.  And of course, it makes dating much easier, since they donÅft have to ask their parents for money.
