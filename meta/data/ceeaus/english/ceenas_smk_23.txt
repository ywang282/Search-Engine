I strongly support the idea of banning smoking not only in restaurants but also in any closed and open spaces. I donft really care about what people do with their own health, but once their choices interferes directly with other peoplefs lives, therefs something wrong. Anyonefs rights always finishes where the otherfs right begins. Therefore, one personfs right to enjoy him or herself in any activity must finish once it enters other peoplefs spaces.
	You canft just drop garbage wherever you want. You must consider other peoplefs lives. It doesnft matter if it is in a restaurant, park or street: you just canft dump it! You must find a proper place. Some people misunderstand that if something is public (and they say they are part of this concept gpublich), they can do whatever they want. This is a common mistake. The concept of gpublich also implies the idea that everyone has the same rights, with the condition of respecting everyone elsefs rights.
	Tobacco is proved to cause cancer and other serious diseases. For this reason, any person smoking not on private places is putting others peoplefs lives at risk. More than a simple fine, the government should consider the total prohibition of consuming tobacco. For the fact it threatens peoples lives, it should receive the status of any other drug, such as cocaine or heroin. 
	People canft continue disposing their gtoxic trashh into other peoplefs lungs in the name of a misused liberty and continue not considering future consequences.
