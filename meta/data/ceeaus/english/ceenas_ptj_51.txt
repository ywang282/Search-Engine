I couldnft agree more! I look around me today and I am really quite shocked at how easy college students have it. Most people now in college have never really wanted for anything and are used to everything being done for them. They all seem to have perfected one skill in particular: going to their parents and begging for, if not outright demanding, that they shell out outrageous amounts of cash for whatever it is that these spoiled students want to spend it on. Therefs really nothing wrong with going on ski trips, traveling to see the world and enjoying your hobbies as a student. If anything, I wish I could of done these things in my student days. My point is that youfre far less likely to appreciate these things for their real value if you didnft have to earn money to pay your own way first, and second, youfll also probably not be able to appreciate the efforts of those who are earning those dollars, namely your parents. By the time students are old enough to go to college, itfs my opinion that theyfre also old enough to understand the value of money, and consequently, learn to respect work and the work of others though getting their own part-time job.
