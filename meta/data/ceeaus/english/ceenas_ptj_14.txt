Students should very definitely work while in college, the harder the job the better. They should learn to suffer. Suffering is important. And it won't kill them.

Part time jobs are often really hard work. But too many college students don't know that hard work can be fun.

Jobs available to students are mostly basic jobs, doing simple tasks. Learning to do basic and simple tasks is an important part of education.

And it's important to have the experience, to know that hard work and suffering and doing menial labor isn't fatal.

But timing is important, too. 

Students who work in Japan are different from students who work in America. Most students in Japan don't pay their own tuition, books, rent, food, or fees, and they don't usually get married while in school. So, where students in America work their way through school, students in Japan generally work to get money for a little more freedom.

In the sophomore year, studying is more important. So most sophomores should focus on studying, and not work at part time jobs. But by the 4th year, it's important to work, to round out an education. If not a part time job, then participation in a service organization can also teach these important lessons.

It is very important for students to work.
