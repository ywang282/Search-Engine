College is an important opportunity for anyone fortunate enough to be able to attend.  Not everyone is able to go to college and college students must use the time they have wisely to learn as much as they can before moving on in life.  It is for this reason that students should refrain from working a part-time job while in school.
There are many benefits to having a part-time job, earning your own money, expanding your circle of friends, etc.  But more than that, having a job takes time.  And as any college student knows, time is their most precious commodity.
Consider an average part-time job, working 20 hours, 5 days a week.  Getting ready for work and driving there and back can easily take an extra hour each day.  That's 25 hours of study time lost per week.
There is also a high risk a part-time job will cause stress.  College is stressful enough without the added frustration of a job.  Maintaining friendly relationships with coworkers is bound to take up even more time.
So while it may be tempting to take a part-time job for the extra money it offers, students should be urged to focus on their studies instead.  They will have to enter the work force soon enough after they graduate.
