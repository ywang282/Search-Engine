I disagree with this statement for the following three reasons.
The first reason is that a college studentÅfs prime purpose in life is to study.  They should spend all their available time learning new things.  This is the best use of their time. Cleaning toilets or serving burgers is a real waste of a college education.

Secondly, I also think that they donÅft really learn anything that useful from working a part time job.  Some people argue that they learn a lot from working while studying.  I disagree. Maybe they learn how to serve someone in a restaurant or clean some dishes but that pales in comparison with learning international law or advanced mechanical engineering. Students should be focused on learning difficult things that they canÅft teach themselves.

Thirdly, I truly believe that the only reason why some students have to have part time jobs is that the cost of education is too high. If it was made more affordable then poor students who are smart, hard working or gifted could get a full and proper education. It would be better for the colleges to reduce their fees and allow the students to spend more time studying rather than working.

I am against the statement because I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to study hard and reach their full potential rather than waste their time doing meaningless, unchallenging and pointless part time jobs.
