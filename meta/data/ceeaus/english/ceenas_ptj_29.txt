	I agree that college students should have a part time job in college.  School is expensive, food is costly and there are many other things that students need money for.  There are many students that have a part time job while in college.  The jobs that students are doing are jobs like working in a convenience store, working in a restaurant, or other jobs assisting busy professionals.  
	There are some students that donÅft need a part time job during college because they have ways of getting money from either their parents or other sources.  The students who donÅft have a part time job might have an advantage because they have more time to spend on their studies however I doubt they use all their extra time studying.
	There is a lot of time in college spent on developing a personÅfs many interests as a way of growing up and figuring out what is personally important.  Although the usual part time jobs are good, there should also be more available jobs in the form of internships in the studentÅfs related field of study.  The actual experience of the job provides a very valuable form of education and students can also gain first hand experience to decide if that profession is truly right for them, while also earning money.  Time is valuable and it would be nice if college education was more aware that the only reason students are studying is so they can get a job.  Jobs can also serve as a way to speed up the process of education so that people can get certified and receive their degree faster.  People can also then have means to raise their children and get an education instead of having to choose between having a family or a successful career.
