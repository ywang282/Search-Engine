Even though this idea may not pertain to Japanese college students as much as it does for students in the U.S. I will voice my opinion anyway. In most U.S. universities once a student is admitted to that particular school that is when the difficulties begin. Conversely speaking, entering most Japanese universities much of the challenges exists prior to entering any particular school. With that said, my opinion is purely based on my knowledge of attending school in the United States.

For many students taking a full-time class schedule is in itself quite time consuming. However, the time spent in classes in addition to the time commuting to and from all the classes is merely the beginning of the day. For many students, probably the majority of students the real schedule begins once they get home.

The real challenge is having ample time to fulfill even the obligatory things one has to accomplish in order to sustain a healthy existence. Yes, we spend time going to and from school, as we spend time actually in class, but there is also so much time spent doing homework that it is sometimes difficult to find time to get proper rest, or time to eat properly because so much time is required to fulfill our class assignments. For these reasons I am opposed to the idea of students taking on additional responsibilities. If too much is taken-on then everything we do may be compromised and not properly completed. I believe we should only take on what we can actually complete with excellence in mind rather than merely finishing for finishing sake.
