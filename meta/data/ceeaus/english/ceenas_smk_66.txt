One of the biggest reasons I believe smoking should be permitted in restaurants is because restaurants are considered places to relax. They are designed to provide an atmosphere for paying customers to come in and enjoy the freedom of having someone serve them. 

Being served, not being responsible for food preparation, or cleanup are a few of the additional services we pay for when we go to a restaurant. In addition, having the freedom to enjoy a drink, or having a cigarette are added reasons why we pay to support restaurants.

If restaurants took away smoking privileges we now enjoy, in my opinion, many people would stop going to these establishments designed to encourage relaxation simply because they would be much less relaxing for smokers, and even stressful for many smokers. Banning smoking would be bad for the economy, as less and less people would want to eat out. 

In addition, going to a restaurant is a personal choice, as is the freedom to smoke. If people dislike smoke for whatever reason, they do not have to frequent restaurants. They can simply create their own smoke-free environment. Nonsmokers can ban together and form a group to avoid smoky areas. For example, nonsmokers can reserve a restaurant that will only accommodate their group, free of smokers. This is one solution nonsmokers have to acquire a smoke-free environment. There are countless ways to achieve smoke free environments. But as it stands now, we have the freedom to go into any restaurant and light up if we desire.
