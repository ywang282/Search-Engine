Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  Smoking is a privilege, though it often seems to be mistaken for a crime.  Within a liberal and democratic society, individuals have the right to decide for themselves what is or is not acceptably harmful to their health.  They do not, however, have the right to individually choose what is acceptably harmful to others.  As such, the choice to smoke and potentially harm oneself should not affect others in a detrimental manner.  There are ways to achieve this end without the complete prohibition of smoking at Japanese restaurants.

One viable option is to mandate the use of separately ventilated smoking-rooms.  In so doing, the hazards of smoking would be effectively confined to those patrons who consent to them.  Yet, this does not address the issue of employee exposure to smoke.  A simple solution to this problem would be to hire staff who also smoke to service the smoking-rooms.  Such recruitment would not necessarily constitute a dubious hiring practice.  This would only be the case if smokers were hired exclusively for all positions or if second-hand smoke inhalation was stipulated as a work requirement for all staff.  Hiring a smoking-room waiter or waitress on the condition that they already smoke is not much different from stipulating that a motorcycle stuntman be able to ride a motorcycle.  Both jobs carry an associated risk and both require a specific qualification on the part of the candidate.  To require the respective qualifications is not discrimination, but a means to assess one's ability to accept the inherent risks.
