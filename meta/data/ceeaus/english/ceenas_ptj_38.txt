I think it is important for college students to work while they are in school.  The reasons are 1) young people will get a sense of the real world, 2) employers look for extra-curricular activities before hiring and 3) students do better in school when they are busy.
First, on the issue of the real world; students are in a bubble when going to school. They have no expectations, no one is managing their time or assignments and when and if they get a job after leaving college, they will have a head start in creating a career without some of the failures of people that have never worked.   A students that has realistic expectations, will have a much easier time adjusting to his future life of work / life balance, which is essential for companies to have employees that wont burn out early in their career.
Secondly, if students work while in college, many employers especially in Japan realize that the best way to gauge a studentÅfs effectiveness is by assessing their ability to multi-task.  Many employers know, grade point averages are not on the concern of most students, so employers have devised a kind of formula based on seeing a student outside of his school environment.  The employer feels that if a student is focused on only school, and excels, they may be a poor candidate for employment.  A well rounded student is much preferred over someone that can complete an assignment.  A student must be able to work with others and a job in college is the perfect test.  
Finally, students and people in general do better when their time is limited.  Idle minds can lead to unproductive students.  If someone can work and pass their classes, the student deserves a job in real life.
