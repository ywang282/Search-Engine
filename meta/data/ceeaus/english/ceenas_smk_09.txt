I support the banning of smoking in all restaurants.  This is a difficult issue since both banning and allowing smoking infringe upon people's rights to an extent.  Banning smoking prevents people from engaging in an activity that is legal in other locations.  But allowing smoking poses a health risk to the general public.
The current situation in many restaurants is a compromise.  Smoking is allowed, but only in specially designated areas.  This compromise, while well-intentioned, simply doesn't work.  Even with an air-tight barrier between sections, opening the door to the smoking section releases large amounts of smoke into the non-smoking section.  A restaurant would have to go to great lengths, using large, expensive fans, for example, to provide a smoking room that truly keeps the smoke in.  In reality the vast majority of restaurants make no attempt to provide such a barrier and couldn't afford to if they wanted to.  At worst a low wall or nothing at all separates the sections.  Obviously being seated on the edge of the non-smoking section next to a concentrated group of smokers would be completely unacceptable to someone with a respiratory condition, for example, or a pregnant woman.
To a non-smoker having to smell and breathe smoke can be anything from mildly annoying to dangerous.  And since a compromise involving separate sections isn't really feasible, I support the banning of smoking in all restaurants.
