The opinion, that it is important for college student to have a part-time job, has some merit. There are several reasons why this is a good idea. 
  Firstly, a college education is a significant expense for a college student and their family. Many families do not have the capital to pay the full cost of a college education and thereby have to cover the tuition by taking out a bank loan and in some cases even mortgaging their house or business. This puts a significant amount of strain on the family finances. Therefore, if college students can assist their families with financing, they should. Even if they donÅft earn enough to help with college tuition, a part-time job can help them pay for all personal expenses or study materials, thereby, reducing the pressure on their parents and encouraging them to become independent, mature adults. 
  Secondly, a significant reason for all young people, including college students, to have part-time jobs is because it is great for the economy. In many countries, including Japan, a large percentage of shoppers are young people. They are the first to take notice of changes in fashion and technology and they often want to buy the latest products, thereby reviving the economy.  
In addition, when college student are working at local shops their labor cost is low, so shop owners can pass these savings onto the customer. This final point is most important to me.
