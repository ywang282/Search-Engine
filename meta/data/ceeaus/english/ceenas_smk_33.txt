I agree with the statement ÅeSmoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in JapanÅf.  
It is well documented that smoking and passive smoking causes premature death.  In Japan smoking causes more deaths than all non-medical causes put together.  Diners who do not smoke should not be exposed to passive cigarette smoke.  Smokers should be encouraged to quit, as smoking related illnesses cost the health system (Japanese Government) millions of yen each year.  It has been found that Åesmoke freeÅf workplaces have reduced the consumption of cigarettes by 21%.  Banning smoking in restaurants would help to reduce the number of cigarettes a person smokes, thus taking pressure off the health system and saving the government a lot of money.
Restaurant owners may argue they will lose business if they become Åenon-smokingÅf.  The Australian government banned smoking in all restaurants, cafes and other places where food is purchased some years ago.  At the time smokers and restaurant owners were opposed to this legislation.  However surveys conducted some time after the legislation was introduced found the number of diners actually increased.  Diners who had previously avoided restaurants due to a dislike of cigarette smoke began to enjoy dining out.  Both staff and diners welcomed the new legislation.  Smokers in Australia are now required to go outside to have a cigarette.  Banning smoking will create a more pleasant and safe environment for staff and as more non-smoking diners begin to dine out, restaurant owners will enjoy increased profits.
