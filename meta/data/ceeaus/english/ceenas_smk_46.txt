As for banning smoking in restaurants, I absolutely believe smoking should be banned. Furthermore, why stop with restaurants? Before I address this question I will give my reasons why I believe smoking should be banned in ALL restaurants. To begin, letÅfs start with the obvious. It has been scientifically proven that second hand smoke has enough toxins to cause lung cancer and many other diseases such as heart disease. In the very worst situations second hand smoke causes death. At the very least, simple discomfort is caused by second hand smoke. From the worst to the least there are countless reasons smoking in restaurants should be banned. Not only should it be banned, in my solicited opinion, it should be illegal. I feel there should be consequences for people who smoke and create a dangerous environment simply because they feel they have the freedom to do as they wish with their lives. I believe these incredibly selfish people lack respect for others. They feel that by not smoking is asking too much of them, as they are basically drug addicts. Everyone knows that drug addicts do not consider others when they need their drug of choice. These selfish people also have polluted ideas of what personal freedoms really are.

I do believe smokers have the right to smoke and should be permitted to smoke regardless of the medical consequences. However, I do not believe that society should not be held responsible for the medical costs caused by smoking. 

Now, to address my earlier question, I believe smoking should be banned in all public areas. And I mean all public areas. Smoking should only be permitted in oneÅfs home. ThatÅfs it! They should not be permitted to smoke outside their own home. Not even in their yard.
