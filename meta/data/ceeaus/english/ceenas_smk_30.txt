I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.  

Smoking affects the health of not only the smoker through direct inhalation, but also those around them through `passive smoking`.  Hence, smoking is harmful to both the smokers themselves, and the other customers in the restaurant who choose not to smoke.  Many restaurants have a smoking section and a non-smoking section, but in my opinion, based on what I have read in recent years, this practice is very ineffective.

From my own experience of growing up in a family where both my parents smoked from a young age, my own health as a child was severely affected by their smoking habit.  My mother smoked when she was pregnant with me, and because of that I suffered from a variety of respiratory problems; sinus, bronchitis, and whooping cough for example.  It is a vicious cycle.  My younger sister also took up smoking and while pregnant, and now her daughter suffers from asthma as well.  

Whether people choose to smoke around their children and others in their own home is their prerogative.  However I believe when smokers are smoking in public, especially in restaurants, that they should be mindful to those around them and the impact that their smoking has on the health of others.  It is selfish for smokers to disregard the health of those around them in restaurants when they smoke.  For this reason, smoking has been banned in restaurants in other countries already.  I would be very happy if smoking was banned at all restaurants in Japan.
