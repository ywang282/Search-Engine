LetÅfs ask ourselves, what is the ultimate purpose:
 To make money? or to improve our academic skills? 
I believe that the college student must concentrate on their studies. 
For this reason I am against anybody working during their college days. 
This is a very short 4 years in which the student can make great advances in their specialized field of research. 
There will be plenty of time after graduation to work but there will never be such an opportunity to make such an in depth study free from mundane worries. The problem with working while going to school is that they will become distracted, tired and eventually lose their concentration, finally their studies will falter. 
It is too much to worry about in addition to their schoolwork. 
They will have long hours, late nights, standing all day with the burden of responsibilities which can wait until after college. I understand that young students are in a hurry to grow up, I feel itÅfs our social responsibility to make sure they take the time to enjoy life too.
They may even be pressured into after hour meetings where drinking is involved.
For these reasons I am completely against the college student taking on too much during these precious years and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed. 
This is where they should be concentrating on their studies.
