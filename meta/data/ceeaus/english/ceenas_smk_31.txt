I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  The following are my list of reasons.

1.	When people go to a restaurant they want a pleasant dining experience.  Even if you set aside a section for smokers everyone can still smell the bad odor.  Most restaurants do not have a special ventilation system to keep smoke in designated areas.   

2.	Second hand smoke is very dangerous but impossible to avoid if others are smoking.  Of course people can just go to a non-smoking restaurant but then their choices are rather limited.   

3.	If you go to a restaurant and there is smoking when you get home you smell like smoke.  Patrons of a restaurant should not have to change clothes and take a shower to freshen up just because someone wanted to smoke.

4.	People that have quit smoking may be tempted to start again when they see other people smoking.

5.	If children see adults they admire smoking in a restaurant they may think that smoking is a good thing.  Then the first chance they get they will start smoking themselves.

So I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants as soon as possible.

Thank you.
