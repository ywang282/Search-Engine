I think it is not important for students to have a part-time job while they are in college. There are two main reasons for my opinion. They are concentration on studies and spending more time with family.

College students should concentrate more on their studies that interest them for the future.  Currently in Japan, I believe a large majority of students study and major in subjects that they will not be interested in at all after their graduation.  They tend to find employment in completely different fields or industry that are not at all related to their four years of study.  Why waste several years studying something that you are not interested in?   
There are some students that have part-time jobs who eventually do dropout of college due to losing interest in their studies and having more interest in making money.  They become trapped with the image of material goods and an exciting social life with the money that they have earned versus the boring life of uninteresting study and having little money to do anything.

Communication is now an important social issue in Japan.  There have been reports in the media that the amount of time communicating together within a typical Japanese family is getting smaller and smaller.
If college students have part-time jobs that are likely to be on the weekends, certainly this would have an effect.  The weekends are an opportunity when all members of a family can possibly gather together and spend time together.
