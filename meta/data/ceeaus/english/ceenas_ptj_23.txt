I really believe that thereÅfs time for studying and thereÅfs time for working. Every student should be able to dedicate him or herself entirely to his or her graduation. No deviation should be allowed. For this reason, I am absolutely against any part-time job executed by any student under any conditions.
	Studying is the most important time in anyoneÅfs life. The result of this period can influence and sometimes determine someoneÅfs fate. Depending on the quality of the studies and the effort made by the student, the result can easily change the destiny of the entire future family and, in some cases, for generations. The damage can be irreversible.
	A bad qualified professional can also mean poor quality and productivity causing lost for companies and, in the end, for the entire nation. Even the environment can suffer; result direct from possible wastes during the production.
	For all the reasons above mentioned, the government and the institutions responsible for the education should make it first priority on their agendas. No excuses for any delay or lack of action on this area can be accepted. Every student should have the right for a good quality education and be assured the necessary conditions for a perfect self-improvement.
