Two reasons why we should ban smokingc Let me seec I remember my last trip to Paris: smoking there has effectively been banned in all restaurants and somehow life goes onc So how is it that even in the home of the Gitanes and the famous gTabac Grish, almost synonymous with French culture, the French themselves have decided to butt out? Many feel that banning smoking is an attack on personal freedomsc Perhaps, but states are there both to preserve freedoms and keep their citizens safe (whether it be from outside dangers or from themselves!). In this case the logic is this: smoking will undeniably damage your health (there are countless studies to prove it) and bring you no benefits (the rush that smokers get from feeding their addiction could hardly be considered  a positive thing). so we will make you stop! Safety and welfare over personal freedom, and itfs that simple. From there I derive my two reasons for banning smoking: I feel that banning smoking in restaurants will be good for peoplefs health, and this in itself should be sufficient. Secondly, and I think more importantly, a ban on smoking shows to all that we have a government that cares and functions properly and intelligently, imposing rules when its citizens are not inclined behave responsibly themselves.
