I disagree with this statement for a few reasons.  There are currently a high percentage of people in the country who smoke and they are being ostracized from their patrons.  Smoking on the street is starting to be outlawed in many cities and the number of places where a person may smoke is slowly decreasing.  If a person cannot smoke in a restaurant, there will become very few places for them to do so.  Ultimately, smokers will be left with nowhere to smoke but their own homes, and I do not need to mention the impact this will have on the millions of children whose parents smoke.
There is no reason why restaurants cannot continue the trend of separating smokers from non-smokers with sections and partitions.  This technique is very effective and satisfies both parties of smokers and non-smokers to the extent whereby non-smokers can only complain about the looming clouds of smoke in the glass box next to them which is pedantic to say the least.  Of course, there are still restaurants where this set-up is non-existent, and this is undoubtedly a cause for grievance among non-smokers and smokers who prefer a clean environment while eating.  The solution is to enforce mandatory segregation for smokers and to ensure that there is adequate ventilation to expel the smoke.  This is a solution that I have already stated works and is a win-win situation for both groups.  There is no need for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants when there are other alternatives.
