Part-time job has done more good things for college students in Japan. It is a worthwhile experience that most college students must go through. It serves as an important element during the preparatory stage ? college education ? for the young Japanese to become productive members of the society. 
Japan is perhaps one country in Asia whereby college students ? generally ? feel obliged to become financially self-supporting. They engage in part-time job to earn, save and augment their financial needs. This whole practice of having a part-time job instils discipline, responsibility, and independence among the youth. 
On the one hand, having a part-time job enables students to earn money, support his/her needs, and save for the future; and, it promotes value for money among college students. On the other hand, the tasks and duties assigned to them teach important virtues such as hard-work, teamwork, and respect for authority and even the value for customers. 
Although part-time job is important for college students, the parents and authorities ? schools and local governments ? must be proactive in providing guidance and setting up the appropriate policy measures to avoid some pitfalls including exploitation and abuse of the students, excessive working hours, and absenteeism and gross negligence of their schooling. 
The main purposes of college students are to: i) attain the right competency ? knowledge, skills and attitude ? of their desired expertise; and, ii) finish their college education. However, let us also not lose sight of the potential gains that can be learned outside the four corners of the classroom. Thus, what is necessary is for students to find the right balance between their studies and part-time work. They should make the most out of their college life.
