I agree that smoking should absolutely be banned at all restaurants in our country. 

Firstly, the evidence is clear. There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke, either through directly smoking or chewing a tobacco product, or by breathing second hand tobacco smoke exhaled by a smoker. No safe level of exposure. None. Period. The danger to the health of restaurant clients and staff is too high. Not to mention the unsuspecting children of tobacco smokers who are too young to be protected by their own educated choice. All these people should be protected from this potentially deadly risk in our restaurants. 

Secondly, the counterargument that banning smoking in restaurants completely will affect the hospitality industry negatively is simply false. Such rules have been put in place in countries and major cities around the world and no downturn in restaurant revenues has been reported. In fact, increased numbers of customers have been reported in some economies. 

Thirdly, the benefits of less people being exposed to tobacco smoke, especially considering JapanÅfs aging population are clear. Smoking causes cancer and heart disease. With an aging population in Japan, and medical costs expected to rise a lot in the coming years, doesnÅft it make sense to reduce exposure to such a great health risk to one hundred percent of restaurant customers? So many people will be at less risk of preventable disease. The government and the medical sector of the economy will save millions of yen and the population will be healthier and more productive physically, and economically. 

For these reasons, I believe that smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants in our country.
