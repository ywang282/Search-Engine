Japan has been embroiled in a bitter sweet love affair with tobacco for centuries. Despite the bitter after-taste the country doesn't look ready to allow the evil weed to loosen its grip. A grip which often seems tightest in the smoke filled atmosphere of the countries famous eateries and izakaya's. 

Calls to ban smoking from these places seem ridiculous when examined against the apparent universal acceptance of smokers indulging their mistress in such establishments. It could be argued, that some of these places even appear to favour the smokers over non-smokers. I have never been in an izakaya that had a non-smoking section. I have, however, been in restaurants where you can sit Ågsmoke freeÅh. These places are often right beside the smoking areas, understandable in a country of limited space and high property prices. But, there is often no attempt to stop the smoke from drifting wherever it pleases. If the owners were more concerned about pleasing the rest of us smoke ventilation would be much more prevalent. 

Perhaps change may be on the horizon, thanks to another force that Japan has a love hate relationship with, America. Although major US chains have been allowed to embrace the Japanese for far less time than cigarettes their influence is strong and all persuasive. Take Starbucks, for example, a new boy on the block, who successfully operates hundreds of shops across Japan while telling their customers to take their smoking outside. McDonald's, while not banning smoking, has started to introduce little glass boxes which imprison smokers and their fumes for all to see. 

It may take sometime for Japanese owned establishments to follow suit. Not while they view pleasing smokers as more important than pleasing everyone else.
