To say, that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, is to imply that it is important for them all to work. Many students need to support themselves through college by working, but for some it just to earn a little extra pocket money. Some students should have as little distractions as possible, for example those studying their final years of medicine.  

For three reasons it can however be a useful life lesson. Firstly it gives students a chance to experience the world of work before they enter into it. They can get a taste of what is to come, or what might be if they don't manage to secure a graduate position.  They also learn what it means to earn money for themselves rather than relying on their parents or support from organisations.  Perhaps this may teach some the true value of money and working. Lastly, it allows them to explore the world lying beyond the college gates. They get to work with people outside of their immediate social circles and meet new people and friends. 

The opportunities that work offers should also be considered against the student's college work load. Too much work may hinder their performance. Not having enough money for books would also be a hindrance. 

I myself worked my way through university. It didn't really get in the way until the last weeks of my final year, when my workload was huge and having to leave it to go and work was not productive. Therefore I conclude now, as I did then, that the student needs to weigh up the benefits and costs of taking on extra work.
