I disagree with this statement for several reasons.
	While it can be argued that having a part-time job is valuable preparation for a full-time job that the student will acquire upon graduation, this is often not the case. In many cases, any part-time employment obtained by a student will be in a field, and of a nature that is completely unrelated to that of their chosen course of study. For example, a student studying engineering has very little valuable experience to gain from working as a waiter in a restaurant. 
	Moreover, there is ample reason for students to not engage in part-time employment. Such a job can often mean a considerable amount of additional stress on top of that created by their studies. The stress of studying can also be increased, as there is less time available to accomplish it. Additionally, many part-time jobs can leave one tired, and thus unable to focus effectively on their studies?resulting in a lower quality of school work being produced. 
Therefore, if a part-time job related to the studentsÅf field of study can be found (such as an internship), then it may be worth pursuing, but otherwise part-time employment should only be sought if it is necessary for financial reasons (i.e., to pay tuition fees).
