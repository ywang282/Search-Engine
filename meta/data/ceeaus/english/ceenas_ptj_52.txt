I agree with this statement for two reasons.  Firstly there is the issue of finance.  Attending tertiary educational institutes puts a large expense on the cost of the student household if they are staying at home and even more if they choose to live outside of parental accommodation, the rent of which is largely financed by parents or guardians.  The cost of education, support, materials, and general living expenses is an enormous sum which in most cases needs to be subsidized by a third party, namely the government and loan institutes.  Even then, the income is rarely adequate enough and therefore students should look to part-time jobs in order to balance expenditure and ease the pressure on their parents or guardians.  The income may be low for the students, yet it yields a double bonus with respect to the money they actually earn, and the money they save from not spending while working.
Secondly, it is important to consider the character-building aspect that part-time work influences on students.  In order to prepare for the Åereal worldÅf is it necessary for younger adults to engage in the same activities as household earners.  Doing this prepares them for their future professions in terms of commitment, diligence, and hard work.  It can be said that the balance of part-time work and full-time study causes stress, however upon leaving their studies and beginning their chosen career they may experience a great relief due to a lower workload.  This relief can help ease the transition to their professional life which has been shown to be traumatizing for some.
