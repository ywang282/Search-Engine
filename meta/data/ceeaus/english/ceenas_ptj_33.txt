I agree with the statement ÅeIt is important for college students to have a part-time job.Åf  By working part time, college students develop their personal and employability skills.  
If students find work in the same field/industry that they are studying they will be able to experience first hand how their studies will help with their future employment.  Having a part-time job will give the student a sample of what it is like in the ÅerealÅf workplace.  Some students may even find they are not suited to the industry they have chosen to study.  This gives them a chance to look at a different career path.
The workplace may be able to assist students with their homework/assignments.  At the same time, students may be able to have valuable input into their workplace, based on what they have learned at college.  
In the workplace the students will be able to develop a variety of workplace skills such as using their initiative, problem solving, communication, teamwork, customer service and interpersonal skills.  All these skills are invaluable on a resume.  
Students working part-time also develop their personal skills.  They will have the responsibly of getting to work on time, being organized with their uniforms etc.  Being in a workplace will help young people to mature and become responsible adults. 
Of course working part-time brings financial independence.  Being financially independent, students are not relying on their parents.  Students also learn to budget, an essential life skill.
It should be pointed out that students should not have so much part-time work that they do not have time to complete their studies.  There must be a balance.
