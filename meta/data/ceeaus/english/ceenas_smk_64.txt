People who object to smoking in restaurants are closet totalitarians; or they are unthinking sheep only too happy to bend a knee before any other garlic-breathed madman waving a manifesto about his unkempt hair. This policy has very little to do with health and everything to do with crushing or corralling every little freedom that remains. Passive smoking is no more a danger to the average person than drinking tap water or eating fruit sprayed with pesticides. One is far more likely to be vaporized by a passing Predator drone than succumb to cancer as the result of inhaling used cigarette smoke. Indeed, studies show that nicotine, one of the more salubrious ingredients in tobacco, not only sharpens the faculties when inhaled, it helps delay the onset of senility (except among Reds, who are notoriously crazy to begin with and should be avoided at all costs). Alzheimers robs those afflicted of many years of productivity and worth to society. Anything that can forestall its hideous advance should be celebrated, not denounced by professional fear-mongers as some kind of health hazard. 
Besides, as anyone who has enjoyed a fine Montecristo cigar will attest, smoking is one of the grander pleasures in life. And smoking, whether cigarette, cigar or pipe, after an expensive meal and in the company of a beautiful woman, is one of the more exquisite experiences one can have on this benighted planet. That some whingeing killjoy nearby objects to the heavenly result of lighting up a fat Cuban and taking in that rich, comforting flavour is of no consequence in the greater scheme of things. Indeed, it is entirely likely the bitter old crone complaining about those magnificent blue wreaths settling over the crockery has never enjoyed a single moment of pleasure in her entire loveless life.
