I completely agree with this statement for the following reasons.
Firstly, so many university students do not study in Japan. They view university as one big party and completely waste their time going out, drinking and joining social clubs and the like. So I think that if they are not going to study then at the least they should work. Maybe they will appreciate their educational opportunity more when they are washing dishes in a restaurant.

My second reason is that working while studying can create great learning experiences. In Australia I studied a business degree at the University of Technology Sydney. There were 8,000 students. 75% were studying part time while working full time. They learned so much more because they knew how the real world really worked. In Australia many big companies hire university students part time also, in order to test out their character. It is a positive thing.
My final point is that if Japanese students have part time jobs then they help pay for the cost of their education. This indirectly makes it cheaper on taxpayers and their parents. It makes the student better appreciate the cost of their education. This will make them study harder. 

So in summary I agree with the idea that Japanese students should have part time jobs. Overall I believe that it is very positive for both the student and the economy.
