I completely and absolutely agree with this statement.
Firstly, second hand smoke kills.  I personally am extremely angry when someone selfishly smokes next to me in a restaurant.  I want to ask them why they are trying to kill me with their smoke.  If you want to kill yourself then smoke at home and do it in private.  Restaurant staff should not have to die from second hand smoke while working nor should customers having a meal. People who smoke in restaurants should be arrested for attempted murder, especially if there are young children around.
Secondly, you cannot enjoy your meal.  It is a known fact that smell and taste go together.  If you cannot smell then you cannot taste.  It is also known that smoke deadens your sense of smell.  I like nothing better than smelling a hot plate of Carbonara or a sizzling t-bone steak before I eat it.  Smelling my food is sometimes better than eating it. When someone smokes next to you in a restaurant they spoil your eating experience.
Lastly, smoking in restaurants makes the place stink.  I like my restaurants to be spotlessly clean.  No one likes to eat food prepared in a dirty place.  What is dirtier than smoke and ash? Nothing.  Smoking is one of the dirtiest things on earth.  It has no place in a restaurant. Smoking is dirty and restaurants should be clean and that is why they should be banned.
So for these three reasons I am completely for totally banning smoking in every restaurant in Japan, sooner rather than later.
