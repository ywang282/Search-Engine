Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  Second-hand smoke is a known carcinogen and detrimental to the health of all who inhale it.  To allow smoking in restaurants, or in any public space for that matter, is to wilfully allow harm to come to all those within that space - smokers and non-smokers alike.  Citizens must have the right to a safe environment in which to enjoy a meal or to work or to live.  Smoking in restaurants cannot stand if Japan is to respect the rights of its citizens.  This does not mean that Japan is to ban smoking wholesale; it remains a right in liberal societies for individuals to choose to expose themselves to risk within limits.  However, this individual right to expose oneself to risk cannot supersede the collective right to safety of all citizens within a given public space.  The freedom of individuals or groups of individuals to smoke within a non-public space, say on privately owned property, is not affected or contested.

Although some workarounds have been proposed, one cannot assume that only smokers will be present within a given public space.  Even if Japan were to mandate the use of separately ventilated smoking-rooms in order to segregate smokers and non-smokers, this would only potentially protect patrons of the restaurant.  Staff who service the smoking-rooms would still be harmed by exposure to the smoke.  To hire only smokers to service the rooms would be tantamount to promoting discriminatory hiring policies.  Asking for employee consent to work in a smoking-room would be equally unacceptable as it leads to a choice between livelihood or health.  A complete ban on smoking at all restaurants is the only way to avoid these pitfalls.
