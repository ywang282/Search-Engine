Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Do you agree or disagree. Use reasons and specific details to support your answer I have many times found myself in uncomfortable situations where I didnÅft wish to smoke but I had to breathe the smoke coming from smoking areas in restaurants and bars.
That is why I completely agree with the statement above. 
Smoking should be banned in the proximity of all public areas not just restaurants.
 In Europe there is already a law that prohibits smoker from smoking in clubs as well as restaurant and it is normal to see smokers step outside to smoke. 
Unfortunately this is not yet a reality in Japan and every year an increasing amount of people  suffer from the diseases caused by second hand smoke . 
Studies about second hand smoke speak for themselves
In addition, in Japan, the tobacco industry is in part responsible for not making aware the public of the dangers of second hand smoke so that makes it even harder to have smoke free areas.
Smoke free areas, it s something that I would like to see and it is something that in my opinion is necessary but is something  that is not likely to happen any time soon seeing and considering several factors like the one I discussed above
