I disagree with the above statement for several reasons.  First, we (thankfully) live not in a communist or fascist nation, but in a democratic one.  The underlying pillar of a democracy is the right to choose how to live.  This right of choice must extend to restaurants.  Ownership should have the right to permit smoking on their premises.  Ownership must, however, be clear in letting both their employees and customers know that smoking is permitted.  I think signage outside the restaurant should be mandatory, clearly stating the smoking situation.  In this manner, both future employees and patrons can exercise their right of choice.  If they wish to accept the harm that smoking related illnesses cause, it is indeed their right.

Must government regulate all lifestyle choices that harm people?  Should Big-Mac sales be regulated, because over indulgence leads to obesity?  Should alcohol sales be banned, because over indulgence/reliance leads to innumerable problems?  No and No.  People have the core right to choose how to live their lives regardless of our agreement.  I personally loathe smoking.  I find it a foul smelling and disgusting habit.  For this reason, I am a big fan of Starbucks, who ban smoking in their stores worldwide.
