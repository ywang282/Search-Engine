It is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Part-time jobs provide real-world experience which can complement one's studies.  This experience may translate to job opportunities after graduation or not; however, the experience of working itself and the added insight into the reality of the working world will always be personally beneficial.  Also, all jobs will provide some extra spending money which will certainly be welcome.

The best choice would be to look for work which complements one's studies.  Often times, looking for work within a lab or as a research assistant to a professor can lead to a well-paying and conveniently located part-time job.  Such a job would also greatly enrich the content of lectures, giving a student the chance to put into practice some of the theory learned in class.  However, it is not always possible to find such a position.  A research job may not even be desirable if a student is not that interested in his studies (although, this scenario leads to certain existentially themed questions).  Regardless, one can still profit from any other form of part-time work.  For example, learning to manage time and prioritize tasks effectively are invaluable skills which can be developed simply by taking on some extra work after school.
