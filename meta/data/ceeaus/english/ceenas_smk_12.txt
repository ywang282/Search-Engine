Despite what we now know about smoking and that it is still one of the leading causes of death in Japan, many people still smoke and begin smoking which seems strange in this day and age.

Smoking has and is currently being phased out in many western nations for the following reasons. It is known that passive smoking can injuriously affect and contribute to those people who donÅft smoke but are surrounded by those that do, such as restaurant, bar and nightclub staff. This is reason enough to enforce such a ban. The effect of second hand smoking is amplified if you are a child, pregnant woman or elderly citizen. In addition to the obvious health affects, second hand smoke can irritate eyes and introduce an unfavourable smell to the premises.

Should someone wish to smoke whilst enjoying a meal, there could be an arrangement whereby the restaurant provides a smoking room or cubicle such as those seen at large public buildings and airports. In other scenarios, the smoker could go outside for a quick cigarette when he or she feels the need. From my own personal experience, restaurants and bars that have brought in substantial smoking bans in my own country, the air quality drastically improves, creating a much more pleasant atmosphere. The absence of smoke felt like an energy boost as breathing was much easier. Until this, I had never realised how energy sapping having a haze of cigarette smoke could be.

By gradually reducing the choice of places where smokers can light up, it may also assist in subconsciously persuading the smoker to finally beat this dangerous habit. I believe that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.
