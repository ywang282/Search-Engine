People who smoke in restaurants should get the death penalty. 

Okay, maybe not the death penalty, but this is not a little thing. It's really quite a big problem, and it's a problem of manners.

Smoking may be important to some people, but, before they smoke, they should ask permission of the people around them. And if people don't want them to smoke around them, they shouldn't smoke there. 

This is especially true in public restaurants, where people eat. We want people to take things into their bodies that will be nutritive, and we want them to enjoy eating nutritious food. It's hard to enjoy food when the flavor is mixed with tobacco smoke, and it's harder for the body to get the nutrition from the food when breathing smoke.

Mothers, in particular, should be careful not to take too much sugar or too much that is spicy. And they should definitely not take poisons into their bodies. Things like tobacco, coffee, and alcohol contain poisons. Poisons aren't good for anyone.

I want people to remember when they were infants. They were dependent on their mothers for their nutrition. Their mothers made great sacrifices to give them their bodies, so they should treat their bodies with great respect.

Also they should not want to cause other people to dirty up their bodies. They should not want to pollute the environment and cause other people to take poisons and unclean things into their bodies.

There should be no reason for people to want to smoke in restaurants. Making it against the law would help people realize this.
