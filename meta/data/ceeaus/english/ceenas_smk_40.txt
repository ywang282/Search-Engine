I completely agree with the statement that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country.
The reasons for my opinion are as follows: second hand smoke, distinctiveness of Japanese food and social etiquette.
I donÅft smoke but get very irritated when someone at the next table smokes near me while IÅfm trying to enjoy my meal in a restaurant.  Alot of smokers have the habit of blowing the smoke above other peoples heads thinking that it is okay and that it wonÅft affect us. There is nothing worse than inhaling smoke and breath mixed together. The dangers of secondhand smoke have widely been covered by the media around the world.  In fact, in many countries, smoking has been completely banned in restaurants, due to the health risks associated with it.

Japan has a lot of food that is well known for its distinctiveness, foods such as sushi, tempura, sukiyaki, okonomiyaki and so on.  A lot of these foods have a unique taste and are served with a distinct sauce mainly for that particular dish.  After smoking a cigarette and then enjoying a carefully prepared dish, I personally donÅft think that you would be able to taste the full flavor of the meal.

I find smokers also tend to have bad manners when I go out with them socially.  While walking to a restaurant or bar, they tend to smoke at the same time, and just before we enter they think it is okay to throw the cigarette on the ground or the closest sewer. Some of them also smoke in front of me without asking if it is okay even while IÅfm still eating.
For the above reasons, I agree 100% with the statement.
