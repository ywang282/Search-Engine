For several reasons, I largely agree with this statement. 
Firstly, having been a college student myself, I am aware of the financial pressures generated as a result of college tuition fees and living expenses. Often, these expenses are met through a combination of loans, grants or family savings, and they usually restrict the student's lifestyle during a crucial period in their adult development. For college students, earning a little extra money is a constructive way of easing these financial pressures and allowing them to lead a more independent and adult lifestyle. 
Secondly, with regards to employment prospects, the level of qualification obtained by the student is rarely the only factor that employers will consider. For the majority of graduate jobs, professional and transferable skills, such as the ability to communicate with customers and to be responsible with their time, are almost as important as academic achievement. Not only is a part-time job a valuable way of demonstrating these attributes, but it also gives students an idea of what aspects of employment they enjoy and what to expect of working life once they graduate. 
Thirdly, on a wider scale, part-time jobs are a necessity in an economical sense. Many businesses require a work force that is flexible and students are very valuable in this regard, as they are able to fill part-time positions that would otherwise be difficult to fill with a full-time member of staff.   
In contrast to these arguments however, it must also be argued that the ability of a student to cope with a job and their academic commitments depends strongly on the student's personal situation. This is largely determined by their financial condition, their year of study and the type of course they are pursuing.
