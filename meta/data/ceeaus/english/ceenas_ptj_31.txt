I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  The following are my list of reasons.

1.	Students learn many interesting things when they are in college.  This is well and good.  However, there is no replacement for real world job experience.  Even if students only work a few hours per week they are gaining invaluable knowledge about business.

2.	Even if parents are wealthy, it is a good idea for their children to learn about making money.  If everything is given to a student and they only study during college they will get out with little idea of what the real world is like.  

3.	If possible students should find a part time job that relates to their field of study.  Sometimes these part time jobs may not have a salary but having such a job on a resume is very helpful.

4.	A part time job can help students to make money and gain confidence in their abilities.  Many of the skills they learn in their part jobs will be useful for future employment.

5.	Having a part time job can be a great way for students to meet new friends and mentors while they are making money.

These are my reasons that support my belief that students in college should have part time jobs.  

Thank you.
