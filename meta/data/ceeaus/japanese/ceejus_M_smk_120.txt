I agree with the opinion that taking a smoke should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Firstly, taking a smoke is bad for the health and cigarettes harm not only those that usually smoke but also surround people near the smokers.

Such people are more likely to suffer from many kinds of disease than those that are never smoking. Statistics show that smokers are likely to die of cancer.

Secondary, those that have ever smoked tend to depend on taking a smoke.

These people are not able to stop smoking if they want to stop taking a smoke.

This sort of people is also highly likely to be tormented by many sorts of illness and die of various kinds of sickness.  

Thirdly, it costs smokers much money to take a smoke.

Moreover cigarettes are very expensive. However cigarettes are a kind of dependence-producing drug, so smokers can not help buying them because they could not live one moment without taking a smoke.

Finally, when someone takes a smoke, those that are having something to eat are likely to hurt their feelings. For this reason, I would say that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
