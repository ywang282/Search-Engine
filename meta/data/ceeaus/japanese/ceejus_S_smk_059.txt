As one of the smokers, I strongly oppose the statement. Most non smokers think that smoking is a bad habit, so they will insist that smoking should be prohibited at all restaurants. But, I think, itfs a fool idea. Today, smoking area is separated from non smoking area at most restaurants in Japan. I have never seen a person who is smoking at non smoking area in the restaurant, because he knows that all people around him hate smoking. Some smokers may get out from the restaurant to smoke, but smoking is prohibited in the public place. So, if smoking was banned at all restaurants, smokers couldnft eat dinner at restaurant. Then, non smokers should suggest that smokers stand smoking when they are at restaurant. I think it is a hard thing for smokers. People usually go to restaurant or cafe to eat foods, have a break, and chat with friends. Everyone wants to take a rest. Cigarettes must be important for smokers to relax. This statement is a selfish idea of non smokers. They often think they are victims of smokers. Such people donft understand the feeling of smokers who choose the smoking area not to irritate non smokers. So restaurants should have the smoking area to save the smokersf rights.
