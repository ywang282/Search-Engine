I think that college studentsÅf having a part-time job is important and necessary.
I have some reasons for this.

First of all, having a part-time job brings us lots of precious experiences.
For example, I work at Starbucks Coffee as a part-time barista.
To work there, I really have to study how to prepare beverages, how to make customers happy and relax, how each coffee beans are different and each oneÅfs tastes, how we can make Starbucks Coffee attractive and so on.
I decided to work there because I have once heard that working at Starbucks Coffee makes people grow up.
I have to memorize many things but I really like to work there since I can study lot from a part-time job.

Secondly, we can earn money by having a part-time job.
Commonly, college students spend more money for going out with friends and so on than high school students.
I have to earn money a bit for my leisure time.
Some of them live by themselves.
In that case, they have to earn money as much as they can.
The only means to making the livelihood is having a part-time job.

From above-mentioned points, I fairly agree with the issue.
