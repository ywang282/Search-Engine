I disagree with the statement.

Tobacco's smoke may do harm not only to smokers themselves but also to people who are near the smokers at restaurants. In fact,scientists say that smoke do more harm to people who are near smokers at restaurants than it do harm to the smokers themselves. So,many people may think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.

But,smokers also have rights to eat lunch at restaurants.Smokers also have rights to eat dinner at restaurants.So,smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.

On the other hand,from the restaurants' perspective,profit have cut down if smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants.Then,Japanese business also will cut down.It is worst thing.
On the meaning of this thing,smoke should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.

The most important problem is that everyone enjoy eating lunch at the restaurants. To achieve the goal,restaurants' staff should divide smokers with no smokers. For example,restaurants'staff should set up big wall between smokers and no smokers.Then,both smokers and no smokers enjoy having lunch.
That is to say,smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants.
