I disagree with an opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons for this.

Firstly, recently in Japan, most restaurants have both of smoking seat and nonsmoking seat. You are asked which seat you like when you come into restaurants. So if you do not smoke or dislike smoke, you can choice nonsmoking seat. I think that it is not necessary to be banned smoking at all restaurants.

Secondly, we often hear that people who smoke love to have a smoke after eating. So they maybe want to have a smoke after they eat in restaurants. Only if there are both of smoking seat and nonsmoking seat, I think that they may smoke after eating.

Many people think that smoking is harmful for their health. Actually, smoking is said that it is worse than useless. And then, clouds of smoke by people who smoke give harm to people who do not smoke. But people who have smoked heavily for a long time depend on cigarette heavily and can not stop smoking immediately. I think that you may smoke unless you keep the manner and do not have trouble anyone. So I disagree with an opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
