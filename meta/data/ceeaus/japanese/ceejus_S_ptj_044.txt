I agree with this statement. Part-time job is a good chance to experience the society for college students. There are many kinds of jobs we can try. All kinds of jobs will do something good for us in the future. Especially I think a job that we service to the customers, such as waiter, is important. This will help us to have an ability of good communication.

 

Part-time job is also easy to start. We only call to the shop and bring a document of ourselves. We have such an easy entrance test, but most of the time we donÅft fail, and then we can start to work. It is really simple. 

 

Some people says college students should not do part-time job. They say StudentÅfs job is studying. I think this way of thinking is not wrong. However this could only say for high school students. College students are adults enough to think about themselves. We know what is good or bad, and what is efficiency or not. 

 

In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but only when we have a time to spare. Of course it is bad if we donÅft have time to study because we are too busy to work. How long and efficiency we work both are also important matters to think.
