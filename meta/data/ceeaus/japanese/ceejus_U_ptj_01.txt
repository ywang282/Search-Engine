 It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this statement. I intend to explain why I think so.
     First, I think that college students shouldnÅft depend on their parents. Because they are not children and colleges cost their parents a lot of money. And many college students think that want to buy many kinds of things and experience various events. So they should earn money by themselves.
     Second, it is important for them to know about society. They can experience many things through a part-time job. For example, how to use respect languages, how to communicate with customers and so on. They will be able to glow through these experiences. 
     Finally, they will be able to meet many important persons at their part-time jobs. For examples, friends, superiors and customers. These people will give them some advices for life. And people who meet at a part-time job may become friends at life for them. To have personal relationships is very important.
     As I have said above, I think that college students should have a part-time job. Surely they will get various things through these jobs. And they will have a full campus life.
