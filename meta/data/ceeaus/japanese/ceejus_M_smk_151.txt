Smoking has tended to dislike by many people since ancient times. These days its tendency seems to strong. It is said that to smoke brings no good and a lot of harm not for any smokers but also neighbors who do not any smoke. Furthermore, smoke that neighbors may take in their body is more dangerous than smokers breathe in. It is what is called Passive Smoking.

Recently Japanese government suggests price of a smoke would be around 1,000 yen. Newspapers search many people what was their opinion for governmentÅfs suggestion. According to the results of an opinion poll, over fifty percents of people who answered questions did not oppose it. If price of a smoke rises, many smokers would stop smoking and then nonsmokers do not have to smoke regardless of grate hate.

If we walk in a city, we would see many smokers. But we can escape from them. By contrast when we are in a restaurant, we cannot escape their smoke. Restaurants must be clean because there are the places where people eat or drink various foods. We might be harmed unconsciously with eating foods because smokeÅfs smoke is likely very strong poison.

From that reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
