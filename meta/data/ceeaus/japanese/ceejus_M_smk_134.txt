In these years, the Japanese government has recommended politics which smokers bother where they smoke calmly. For example, the government made streets nobody can walk or stay with smoking. We got cities clean and enjoy walking comfortably. Most people translate it as a very attractive policy.

So, all the restaurants in Japan should completely banned smoking too. We can especially find many bad situations in the restaurant. Their smoke makes not only them but also non-smoking customers more tasteless. If non-smoker were sitting far from smokers, they could not avoid smoke coming up. Then, passive smoking is a great important problem. As you know, smoking does damage smokerÅfs lugs and it leads smokers to have various bad diseases. Moreover, those diseases have a possibility to affect health of non-smokers who breathe smoke surrounding them. Smoke is more dangerous than we usually consider. Actually, smokers have troubled non-smokers while it is unknown. The restaurantÅfs floor is restricted within a narrow space. And customers sometimes turn up to eat with little children. So, all people at the restaurant are should be more attention to smoking.

In Japan, most people have seen smoking in any appearances in a new light. That present condition teaches us an importance to consider doing smoke. What smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan must bring good consequences.
