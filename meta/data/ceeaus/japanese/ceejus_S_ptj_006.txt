I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
 First, they should experience and know what working among adults is like before they graduate the college and start working as an official worker. Company offices are very different from schools because the former is the place to make benefits and the latter is the place to study and make friends. If they donÅft know the gap until they graduate the college, they will feel working adults are very cruel and will not be able to adjust the new environment smoothly.
 Second, they should know the worth of money when they are students. They have much time to play and tend to spend their money wastefully. If they have a part time job and know how hard earning some money is, they consider the importance of money.
 Last week I started a part time job. It was similar to the job of waitress who carry dishes, hosts and gives various services to the guests at a hotel in Osaka. This job was very hard. As I was a very beginner, I often made a mistake and got into troubles. However, I learned many things through the work and I am sure that the days I worked at the hotel are very valuable.
 Therefore I think that having a part time job is good for college students and makes their life more enjoyable.
