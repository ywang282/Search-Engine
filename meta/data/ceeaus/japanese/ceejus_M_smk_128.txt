Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan,
because smoking have a bad influence upon the smoking person but also
surrounding. I donÅft smoke, and I donÅft like. Smoke of tobacco. When
someone smokes around me, I get angry with his smoke makes my body bad. I go
to a restaurant with smoker, I choose the nonsmoking seat as possible. There
are all lot of people like me in Japan, and almost those people endure. If
smoking is completely banned at restaurants, nonsmoker go in restaurants in
peace. On the condition that restaurants ban smoking, there is no risk. To
put it the other way around, the number of customers increase than before.
It is better that smokers who want to smoke go out and smoke outdoor.
 As another reason, banning smoking makes cleaning more easily. Smoking
discharge smoke include tar which strain the ceiling and so on, and
cigarette butts are left. Cleaning these is troublesome for employees. But
by banning smoking, employees have no need to wash an ashtray and wipe the
ceiling that is dirty with tar. According to this, employees can go back
home earlier and rest in their home.
 So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
