I think it is important for college student to have a part time job. I have two reasons. 
First, we college students need money, when we join a club and enjoy with friends. However, I think that college students shouldnÅft take a lot of money from parents. We are not children. We shouldnÅft dependent on our parents too much, so I think we should earn money to enjoy with our friends.
Second, I think that a part time job give me good experience. I work in a hotel, and I leaned etiquette and manners there. I think if I had not worked there, I couldnÅft have learned these things. Moreover, I think I can be patient. I sometimes feel angry to co-workers or customers, but I must to be patient. I was given money, so I need to be patient. I think that is work. This experience will help me when I work in a company after graduating from university. 
 However, we college student should not work too much, because the most important thing for college student is to study. Therefore, I think a part time job is important for college student, but we should do it as it doesnÅft interfere with study.
