I agree with this opinion because of two reasons. First of all, I think it is important to learn importance of money. We, majority of students, are given money, food, clothe, books Åcand almost everything that we should need by our parents or relatives. However we donÅft know that getting money is very difficult and hard, so we should have part-time jobs and learn importance of money. Second, we donÅft know about a system of our society and rules of our society. For example, we donÅft know how to manage a company or we donÅft know importance to keep our promise. It is very serious for us because we will have to work in there after our graduation. Therefore we should learn it from part-time jobs while we are students. I have a part-time job too. It is a cram school teacher. I teach my students on every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday but I can get only 30,000 yen/a month. In fact, I am impressed that getting money is very difficult and hard and I learn a lot of rules of our society from my part-time job. I feel that I could know my parentÅfs difficulties a little. For these reasons I agree with this opinion.
