"I agree with this statement, and I actually do a part-time job after my classes. I think it necessary to do a part-time job. 

First, we learn many things in working. I think that the part-time job is a chance of learning to fit into society. College students will become a member of society in the near future, so it is very important for us to learn the society. The most important thing I have learned is that many kinds of people live in the world and I have to broaden my outlook.

Besides, college student is a grown-up, though he studies in university. So we have to take care of ourselves little by little. When I began to do a part-time job, I know for the first time the difficulty of earning my living. And I realized how much I owe my parents.

Moreover, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. We have a lot of time to spare in our school days. So we often want to enjoy traveling with our friends. We also want to enjoy our hobby. In either case, we need a lot of money. So we have to keep on working to earn more. 

Therefore, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.
