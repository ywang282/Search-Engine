"I agree this statement.

 First of all it is because the college student should not only study. I
think that it is important for the college student to experience
part-time job when he or she works in society in future. But, if the
college student neglected studying, it is putting the cart before the
horse. The balance of studying and part-time job is also studying. I
think that part-time job is the first step which he or she experiences
society. So, he or she will have various experiences,Å@but those all are
called society. If he or she donÅft such an experience and come out in
society, he or she will be instantly confused. ThereforeÅ@he or she
should have such an experience as soon as possible.

Second, probably most college students had gotten allowance until now.
So, he or she understood difficulties of earning money. If he or she
works at a part-time job, he or she will be able to understand correctly
the importance of money and difficulties of earning job.  If he or she
does so, he ore she will not waste instantly.

Naturally there are other various opinions. It is sure that there are
bad points in which studying tends to be neglected etc. However he or
she will get things beyond them.

From the above statement I agree this theme.
