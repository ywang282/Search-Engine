  I think the college students should have a part-time job because they can learn to work as one portion in society. For example, they will learn how difficult is it to earn money and will not spend money idly. I donÅft have a part-time job now. But I had worked at super market for one month. In spite of short time, I learned how to handle cash register, earn money, say greeting, behave to customers and etc. 
  There may be an opinion that if the college students have time to work part-time, they should fill up more student life. But today we can have a part-time job if there is time just a little. So they can enjoy student life and have a part-time job.
   I think that it is better changing various part-time jobs than remaining one part-time job all the time because we can learn various thingsÅDFor  instance, we will find our good point and bad point and the work that fitted oneself.  
  For these reason, the part-time job has many good points for the college students to grow up the adults. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
