It is said that smoking is harmful. On the other hand, there is an opinion
that smoking is harmless, too. I cannot judge whether smoking is harmful.
However, I want to assume that smoking is harmful and to express my opinion.

I think that smoking should not completely banned at all the restaurants in
Japan .Because the no smoking seat and the smoking seat have already been
divided, I think that it need not limit more than now . There may be a
person who regards passive smoking as a problem, too, but I think it won't
be a problem at all if a designer cares about to air conditioning. I think
that the modern society becomes strict with a smoker. I think that the
reason is that feelings that the Japanese wants to belong to the majority
are strong. I think that they want to think that does a good action by
blaming the minority. I do not trust mass communication and the government,
and I think that it is necessary for people to think whether all matters are
always true. The sale of the cigarette should be prohibited if smoking
should be really prohibited. However, the reality is not so. A tax enters by
a smoker. Therefore I think that the government does not prohibit a
cigarette. 
I think that it is important to watch from various angles. Therefore I think
that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan in
view of economical aspect and psychological aspect .
