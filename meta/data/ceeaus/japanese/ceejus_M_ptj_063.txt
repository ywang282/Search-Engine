I donÅft agree with part time jobs of college students partially. It is because part time jobs have not only good aspects but also bad aspects.
 First of all, its good aspect, part time jobs gives college student many experiences. For example, if you work as a crew of convenience stores, you meet many people. But you had to do many things; using the register for payments and putting commodities on the show cases orderly, accepting goods for door-to-door delivery service, etc. All crews wear the blue striped shirts as uniform in store. Whenever customers come and go, we all say ÅgIrasshaimase (Welcome)Åh orÅgArigato-gozaimashita (Thank you)Åh loudly in unnatural accent. Convenience stores part time jobs is very easy for us, but deferent part time job may be very difficult or busy Åc But they are student. College studentÅfs real job is to study and to learn. Some of college studentÅfs goal is entering employment. Such students can use internship program. This is different from part time jobs, it is not only job but also study. But this is for such students. I agree with this pattern job. But just an ordinary part time jobs is not good for student much.
