I agree with the statement. And I think it is important for college students t
o have a part-time-job. I have two reasons.
Firstly, I think that part-time-job is one of learning society. Part-time-job 
provides college students with many important things. For example, They can kn
ow severeness of society, manners in working, and pleasure of salary. I think 
these experience surely raise a person.
Most people have to work after graduating university or graduate school. If he
 or she has never worked before then, I think it is very dangerous. I think it
 is too hard for a person who has never had part-time-job to work suddenly in 
this severe society. It is necessary to experience walking during college stud
ent. 
Secondly, college students need a lot of money. Elementary school, junior high
 school, and high school students usually can get their money from their paren
ts every month. However, college students are not children yet. So I think the
y have to earn their money by oneself. Thanks to a part-time-job, college stud
ents can help their parents.
Part-time-job brings us great experience and money. I experienced and learned 
many things through a part-time-job too. I think these are very worthful. I th
ink college students should have a part-time-job.
