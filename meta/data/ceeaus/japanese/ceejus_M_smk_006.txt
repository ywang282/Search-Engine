I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Actually, in many public place smoking is banned. Especially I donÅft think that they should smoke at the street over walking. But I think they may smoke at the restaurant. Some friends of mine smoke, and they say that smoking can get rid of stress for them. At the restaurant I have a part-time job the guests can smoke at all seats. When I see them smoking during job, it seems that they take a rest by smoking. 
  But, the other hand, some guests hate smoking. I am often inquired if there is a non-smoking room. Some of them give up entering my restaurant because of we have no non-smoking room. I donÅft smoke, so I also can understand their thinking that smoking does harm. 
 As a result, I think that there should be two spaces at the restaurant: smoking room and non-smoking room. Then both smoker and non-smoker will be able to enjoy eating and talking at the restaurant. And I think they can spend comfortable at the restaurant. At not only restaurant but also other places it is important for them to understand their thinking each other. Then I think they can live more comfortable.
