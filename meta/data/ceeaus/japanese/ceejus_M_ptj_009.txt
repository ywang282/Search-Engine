I agree with this opinion ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part-time jobÅh.
I think it is important to gain social experience by a part-time job. Because, many college students have lived in the limited relation of people that is called school. They donÅft know the large relations of people in the society. In it, there are many kinds of people. For example, people who help them or interfere them. In the school, if they think they donÅft like some people, they can avoid that one. But in the society, there are some cases that they canÅft avoid someone who they donÅft like. They can know it by a part-time job.
I also think they can know the importance of money by having a part-time job. They have been given money from their parents. They donÅft know how hard earning money is. So they sometimes waste money. If they have a part-time job, they can know it is hard to earn money by working. If they know this, they decrease the frequency of wasting money and they can know the troubles of their parents on working. They respect their parents.
I agree with this statement according to that two reason.
