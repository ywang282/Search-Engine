
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, too. I have many reasons.

First, college students have much more time to use freely than junior high school students, high school students and adults who have jobs. So they can use time usefully by having a part-time job.

Second, they can get to know how difficult to earn money is and how important money is. Therefore they will be saving money. And they can deposit money.

Third, they can get many opportunities to be known various generations. And so they can have wide views. If they work at restaurant they can learn etiquette, if they work at cram school they can expose to children and their parents, so they can know the present state of education. This may be reference to decide their occupation.

Fourth, as they are near to adult or they are already adult, it is not good to depend on their parents for money. By having a part-time job they can live their own life. After they graduate from college this may be useful. Because the must live without help of their parents someday. For these reasons I think college students must have part-time jobs.
