I agree this opinion. First, college students donÅft have so much money. They difficult to live with only money their parents sent to them because they need money for their club activity and so on. Second, a part time job offers them opportunity to learn manner or moral. For example, they can learn the way of speaking with customer or their boss. They can experience a lot of things they canÅft experience in college before they graduate from it. They can also make friends with someone who isnÅft their college including other generation people. I think expanding connection with people is important in our lives.  Third, I think they can use time better when they have a job than when they donÅft have it. When they only go to a college and donÅft have a job, they apt to think that they have much time but when they go to a college and have a job, they want to use their time efficiently. Having a part time job helps them take the balance in their lives. 
They can also understand what to get money by working themselves is like. They can make ready to work in society by having a part time job. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job if they donÅft forget to study.
