"I agree the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for the following reasons.
The first reason is that college students can learn difficulty of earning money by doing part-time job.  They become knowing how hard their parents work for their family.  They can understand the importance of money and their parents.

The second reason is that they can reduce the burden of their parents.  College students need a lot of money such as for living, school, amusement and so on.  If they don't do a part-time job, their parents have to pay the all of that money.  It is very heavy burden for their parents.  They should earn money and reduce the burden of their parents.

The final reason is that they can know which job is suited to them.  They can do many kind of part-time jobs for four years for example a waiter, an office work and so on.  One student may realize that he is good at service to people.  The other student may realize that he is good at the work of using computer.  Doing part-time job will be help to college students when they look for their future job. 

That is why I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.   "
