People are banned from smoking at some restaurants. I think that it is a good idea. This is because smoking do harm to many people at some aspects. First, smoke of cigarettes causes healthy damage. Even if people donft smoke at all, they may suffer from lung cancer in the future by breathing in smoke of cigarettes. Recently, many seats at restaurants are separated smoking seats and no-smoking seats. In that situation, however, the clerks breathe in smoke of cigarettes, and customer near the smoking seats are also affected by it. Second, many people dislike the smell and the dirty of cigarettes. In fact, I dislike it. When I take a Shinkansen, I am sometimes annoyed by it. The smell of cigarettes sticks not only to smokerfs clothes but also to other peoplefs clothes. Moreover, it sticks to seats, curtains, table covers, and so on. If customers who donft like cigarettes smell it, they will be uncomfortable. In addition to it, the dirt of 
cigarettes ruins an atmosphere at the restaurants. The clerks there have to clean more carefully to make the customers comfortable. Accordingly, I think that it is a good idea to set smoking room. In that case, nonsmokers arenft damaged by the smoke of cigarettes. People can enjoy eating at restaurants under the great circumstance.
