I donft agree with the suggestion.
 If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, some
people donft be satisfied. My father likes to smoke. So he wants to sit
down a seat that people can smoke in restaurants. One day our family
planed to eat out near the restaurant. However, we couldnft take a meal
because smoking is banned in there.
 Provided that the member of a family smokes well, they will look for
the place where people smoke freely. It is the same things in
restaurant. But many people donft like a tobacco and people to smoke in
recently society. The area that people donft smoke in is important
because the smoke of a cigarette is worse for our health. Yet it is
overdoing that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.
 The men who run the restaurants should think another way that smoking
and no smoking people can go there at the same time. For example, they
make a wall between smoking area and no smoking area or buy garbage for
ash of the cigarette to absorb the smoke of it. I think it isnft only
satisfied way for everyone that smoking is completely banned. So I
object that opinion.
