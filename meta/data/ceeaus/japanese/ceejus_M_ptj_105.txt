"I agree with this statement,because we need pay much money in some reasons.


We are adults.We should not be dependent on our parents.So,we should not bring lunch boxes which our mothers made but buy lunch boxes with our own money.But,we moreover pay money when we play in some clubs or circles.


For example,I belong to a cappella circle and a gardening club.

In a cappella circle,because a cappella circle members love singing songs,we often go to karaoke room in order to sing songs.We can sing songs in karaoke room with low price.So,you may think we need not pay much money,but we very often go to karaoke room.

In a gardening club,we suppose to go to bars twice in next week in order to become familier with the other members.We want to get good friends.Therefore,we need to have such chances.Then we must pay much money!


In this way,we need to have much money to enjoy our campus lives.To get the goal,we must get income by having a part-time job.So,I agree with this statement.

In fact,I am going to have a part-time job."
