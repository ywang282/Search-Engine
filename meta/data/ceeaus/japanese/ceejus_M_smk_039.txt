 I agree with the statement. In public areas, I think, people should not be admitted to smoke.
 Until the time I spent at Kobe University for a few months, I thought that the only thing to do was to separate smoking areas from non-smoking areas. Then people who did not smoke could avoid othersÅf smoking. But I was noticed it was not true. Let me talk about places outside restaurants for preparation for the main topic.
 I have seen many Kobe University students smoking at corridors and exteriors. I have also seen people smoking at stations or the places more than three meters from the smoking areas. They are non-smoking areas. I think people who love smoking cannot will to bear non-smoking situations.
 In restaurants, the main topic here, the matters even more vary. Restaurants are small domains but interiors. There, people on non-smoking seats will not smoke because they are extremely controlled by other peopleÅfs eyes. But, smoke caused at admitted seats more or less goes to non-smoking seats. Also, non-smokers often sit on admitted seats in crowded restaurants.
 The only way they protect people from smoking is to ban it in public domains, of course with laws. Certainly punishing hard is not always the best way. Crimes by boys and girls seem not to be reducing despite increasing hard punishes. But smoking is not the same with killing a person. Feelings toward killing could sometimes become unbearable, but feelings toward smoking will not if there is punish.
 There are many people who hate the smell of othersÅf smoking. Smoking is also harmful for the health of people around smokers. The number of smokers, especially of young ones, is decreasing from year to year. It is time to increase non-smoking areas greatly, and ban all smoking inside the areas.
