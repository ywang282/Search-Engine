Is it important for college students to have a part-time job?
I really donft want to say itfs important, but most of the students will need to, so I agree.
Happily, most of Japanese college students donft have to earn school expenses by themselves. What they need is the money to buy books, CDs and clothes or to enjoy their hobbies, so they donft have to work so many hours.
I think that the thing which students have to precede the most is study. Some might say that it is important to gain social experiences. But we gain them whether we want to or not when we graduate from university. So if they donft need to have a part-time job, they donft have to.
However, I donft think it is good for college students to be given pocket money monthly by their parents. Some high school students arenft allowed to have part-time job by their school rules, but there must be no university or college that forbids students to have part-time job.
Of course there are some students who canft have part-time job because their study is too hard. In such case I think itfs ok to get pocket money.
