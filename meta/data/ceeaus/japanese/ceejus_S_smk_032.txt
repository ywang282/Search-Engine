I disagree with the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  This is the only an opinion for people who donÅft smoke. For people who smoke, smoking is kind of their lifework. Smoker canÅft live without smoking. Even in restaurants, smoker needs to smoke after all the food came out. For example, in a bar we usually stay even though we finish eating. Smokers canÅft relax without smoking. I think bar is a place we can relax and free to talk. WouldnÅft this statement wrong from the definition of bar?

 

In the first place, why we have to ban smoking? Because we canÅft eat delicious food with smoke? I know smoking is not healthy for not only smokers but also people next to the smokers. Of course it is bad to involve other people, especially to the non-smokers. So what I suggest is to separate the room for smoking and non-smoking completely. We can see this system in most of the family restaurants in Japan today already. I think this work very well and both smokers and non-smokers are satisfied.

 

However, in one place I wanted to be banned smoking. It is cafe! Cafe is a place where we enjoy both taste and smell. I think this is the only exception!
