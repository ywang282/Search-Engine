In Japan, smoking should be prohibited at the whole restaurant.
Because the smoke makes many people feel very uncomfortable. It smells
bad.
Besides, non-smoking people, especially the children, breathe the
smoke. The smoke has very bad effect for their health, and fewer than
20 children are banned smoking by law. It does harm for children's
growth. Though they received such infection for only eating at the
restaurant. It is foolish.
Of course, there are many restaurant that separate non smoking seats
from smoking seats. But the smoke moves in the room. Although it is
better that sitting on non smoking seats than on smoking seats,
sitting on non-smoking seats doesn't mean it is divided from the
smoke.
Smoking itself is not wrong but bothering other people is really
wrong. In public spaces like the restaurants should establish smoking
space which separated completely from non smoking spaces for instance
out of the restaurant. In these spaces, smokers are allowed to smoke.
To do this, most smokers go out of the restaurant to smoke. It is sure
that eating at non smoking restaurant is very comfortable for non
smoker. Certainly many people hope so.
For all the people's safe and comfort, at the restaurant the smoking
should be banned completely.
