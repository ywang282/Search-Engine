I agree with this opinion, because smoking in the restaurant will cause a lot of problem. When people smoke in the restaurant, there will be a lot of smokes. A lot of people know that people who are smoking catch a lot of harms and some people donÅft know that people who inhale the smokes catch much more harms. Then if there are some people who are smoking in the restaurant, people around them must inhale smokes and they will catch a bad influence for their health. It is strange that people who live in good health get bad influence from people who are smoking. I also think that if there are some smokes in the restaurant, the air in there will be dirty. There are a lot of foods in the restaurant and if the air is dirty, the foods also will get dirty and have bad influence for the health. It is one of the important selling points for the restaurant to give fresh and clean foods for the guests. Not having that point and having smokes in the restaurant donÅft make the restaurant have a good reputation. Then smoking should not be permitted and banned at the Japanese restaurant.
