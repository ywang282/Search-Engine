I agree with this statement. I suggest that smoking should be banned at not only all the restaurants but also all the public place. I have some reasons for thinking so.

     First, smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to people around smokers. When people are smoking, smokes come out and people around smokers take in that smokes automatically. This is called passive smoking. Passive smoking is much more harmful to our bodies than smoking. Therefore, smoking should be banned at public place where there may be people who do not want to smoke.

     Second, I hate smell of cigarettes and I think some people think so. If I go to a restaurant, eat delicious dishes and feel so happy, once I smell cigarettes, I feel so bad even in non-smoking seat. This is because I maybe feel that the dishes taste bad and clothes smell smokes of cigarettes.

     Third, if people walk with smoking, it might be dangerous for people, especially for children, to be burned by cigarettes. Recently, walking with smoking is decreasing in the effect of commercials, but walkers with smoking still remain. Walking with smoking causes another problem. That is throwing cigarettes away. It makes beauty of cities bad.

     In conclusion, smoking is harmful to all people and makes some people feel bad. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all public places.
