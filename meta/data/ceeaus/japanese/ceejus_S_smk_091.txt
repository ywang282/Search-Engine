Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant. First, smoking does
harm to non-smoker. If your family smokes, you can prevent passive smoking.
For example, you tell your family not to smoke in your house, you open the
window. But you can
Åft avoid passive smoking in the restaurant. It turned out that smoke does
much harm to nonsmoker than smoker. If you are pregnant woman, smoking does
much harm her. Moreover, passive smoking in the public space, smoker doesn
Åft take the responsibility for their smoking. Non-smoker has to accept
passive smoking. It is not too much to say, smoker is murderer. In fact,
more than 1000 people have died due to passive smoking. It is clear smoking
is harmful to non-smoker. It is incomprehensible that smoking is allowed at
the public space.
Smoking has a bud influence upon not only their health but also their
feeling. If you are non-smoker, smoke makes you unpleasant. Besides, you
would be at the table at the restaurant. You may be not able to enjoy your
food because of smoking. In the public space, non-smoker
Åfs charge and smokerÅfs charge are equal. It is unfair that only
non-smoker is unpleasant.
Thus, smoking bothers many people. Smoking at the restaurant should be
banned immediately.
