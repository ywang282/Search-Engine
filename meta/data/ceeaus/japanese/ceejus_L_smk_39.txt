I am opposite to the complete prohibition of smoking at a restaurant. Recently, I think that the second hand smoke hardly influences it of most because it has delimited the smoking seat and the no-smoking zone at a restaurant. It is ..right to spend.. certain in a surrounding guest from the restaurant to the guest the smoker though it is thought that it troubles because it takes in the second hand smoke and the smell, etc. comfortable in the store the reason to prohibit inside of a store smoking the restaurant otherwise, the restaurant side will select the guest. 
However, if it is usual "Restaurant" at any rate in case of the tavern, I think that it should refrain from smoking a little. It is necessary to refrain from smoking that exerts a lot of guests of the child taking are in the restaurant, and a bad influence for such a child in no small way as adult manners. Limiting or prohibiting smoking with the restaurant in such a meaning might have the meaning. I think that thinking about the balance of the person who wants to spend restaurant meals comfortably and the person who should defend from the second hand smoke by smoking is important.
