I think that university students should work part time job.
It is true that if they do it, they must reduce their time to study.
But, in a long term, we can regard the four years of campus life as a ready for being a member of society.
University and college are places where students study very hard and become specialists about their specialty.
And they work remarkably as specialists in company and laboratory.
But, if they had great talents, it would be no use if they behave worse.
Society demands them for manner as a factor of community.
But they canÅft acquire its manner only in university.
So, part time job is available for us to acquire its manner.
We must learn manner, for example, how to contact with boss, colleagues, and guests, existing a seniority system.
Moreover, they must notice ''lie''.
In society, many people are not so kind.
There are a lot of dirty faces in society.
We have to associate with their unfavorable sides.
To get along with bad surfaces of society is demanded them.

First, we belong to family.
Second, we belong to school.
Third, we belong to society.
Thus, we belong to bigger and bigger community.
Large community demands members for more things.
So students should work part time job to acquire manners.
