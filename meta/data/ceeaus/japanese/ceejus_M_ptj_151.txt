"I think it is very important for college school students.We need so much money.For example if I live by myself,we waste money.So I need to earn money.This is most important reason.I think there are two other reasons
 
 First,club activity.We had better join any clubs.Because,we can make many friends.I think our duty is experiencing many kinds of thing.We must challenging many kinds opf thing.But it will make us waste so much money.We need money to get great experience.
 
 Second,we must know society.Though it will make us know a little world,it will help us someday.In brief,part-time job is learning of society.Maybe a person who doesn't work can't understand inportance of money.There is difference between thinking and doing.It may be great experience in that sort of meaning.
 
 This is why I think part-time job is important for us.But,I must not remenber that most important thing is school work.Our duty is experiencing many kinds of thing and schoolwork.I thinkl great college school student is the person who can do all things perfectly.
