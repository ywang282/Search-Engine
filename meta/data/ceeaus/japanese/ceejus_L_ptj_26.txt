"I agree that college students work part-time. I think that t
he working make us to acquire sociality that doesnÅft obtain
 it at school. A university student who is mentally mature t
han the high school student might obtain more. Of course, th
ere is a limit. We mustnÅft neglect our studies because of t
he part-time job. I think, when we work part-time, it is nec
essary to consider the working time.
 Moreover, it is one of the big reasons why university stude
nts need a lot of money. The person who was attending high s
chool with the uniform should buy some clothes, and the text
 book and the reference book are more expensive than high sc
hool days because they are special. Human relations expand, 
and it increases association such as parties. The person who
 joins a club spends money on club activities, and someone h
as to earn the cost of living.
 In these reasons for which money is necessary, there is som
ething to enjoy the university. Most people who oppose the p
art-time job of university students will have dissatisfactio
n with which these enjoyments decrease the time to study. In
 short, I think that the university life is massive if the b
alance of the study and the enjoyment is good.
