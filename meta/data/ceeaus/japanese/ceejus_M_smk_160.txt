Recently, smoking has been banned in public places. This trend is spreading the entire world. 

For instance, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Finland, Singapore and the EU smoking is prohibited in public place and fine for smoking is very much. Yet in Japan there are a few places where smoking is banned. And fine is small. So compared with the law of smoking in developed countries that of Japanese is so slack that the government in Japan has to enforce the strict rule.

Public places should be comfortable and relaxing for everyone. But smoking is a very bad smell for some people who don't smoke. Restaurant is public place and all of people have to be able to relaxing there. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.

And the cigarette smoke make dishes awful. Some restaurants have divided the spaces into two areas, smoking area and nonsmoking areas. Yet this system is not enough to completely provide smoke from streaming into nonsmoking area. Besides lately, plenty of hotels have decided to forbid smoking there. After this, most of place, of course streets, smoking are banned. People have better smoke in smoking room not to hurt people's feeling.
