I agree with this opinion. ItÅfs because it is a student, and it is a period to look at the world during a university student.
Nowadays we say that the young donÅft know system of society.
Therefore we have to look at the world during a university student.
We are able to know system of society by looking at the world and to understand pleasure of working by a part time job.
For example, a private supplementary schoolÅfs teacher is a good practice and experience for students who want to be a teacher.
In other words, we are able to experience a good one for the oneÅfs future.
Though we have to study because we are students, we have to know importance of working.
The young who donÅft know this become NEET.
Therefore doing a part time job during a university student reduces NEET.
Japanese economy is very warning situation now.
To reduce NEET is to save Japanese economy.
We should know this for Japanese economyÅfs future.
I work part-time now, and it is important to absorb various things from the society simply because it is a university student making future in the future.
LetÅfs do a part time job and know society.
