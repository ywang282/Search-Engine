@I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan is very good idea. There are two reasons why I think so.

 First, I donft like smoking. Of course, I donft smoking because smoking has much harm but donft have any merit. For other reason, smoking needs a lot of money. At these reasons, I donft like smoking. If I donft smoking but other people smoking near by me, the smoke may come into my breath. At this, smoking harm not only smoking people but also not smoking people. Now, smoking completely banned at all the university building. So, the same thing can do at all the restaurants.

 Second, smoker can smoke at the out of restaurant. If smoker want to smoke, he or she only pay the dinnerfs money and smoke at the out of restaurant or in onefs car. Surely, there are smoking seat and non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but the air in the restaurant is a little staled because smoking seat and non-smoking seat are just exist in the same building. And the smoke has bad smell, so that is inconvenient for the person who wants to taste the dinnerfs flavor.

 For the reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at al the restaurants in Japan.
