I donft agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons for this.
First, restaurants are the place not only to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner, but also to take rest. In order to rest, some people eat and chat, other people smoke. Smoking is a kind of rest for smoking people. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, they will lose one of their places to rest.
Second, I think we donft need to ban smoking completely. Nowadays almost all seats in restaurants are divided into gsmoking seath and gnon-smoking seath. I propose to increase the number of gnon-smoking seat,h in order for non-smoking people to be comfortable, or to isolate gsmoking seath from gnon-smoking seath by making walls made by glass.
For these reasons, I donft agree to ban smoking at restaurants completely, in spite that I donft smoke. Smoking decreases our health, I know, but from the side of smoking people, smoking is a part of his life, so it is almost impossible to inhibit smoking people to smoke. Of course we need to separate gsmoking seath and gnon-smoking seath strictly
