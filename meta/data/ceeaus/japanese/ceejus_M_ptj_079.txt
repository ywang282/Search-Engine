I agree with this statement. I have two main reasons.

First, college students often go to the places where we have to spend money to play such as amusement parks, JYANNBOKARAOKE, RAUND1, bars and so on. If they donÅft have a part-time job and being paid such expenses by their parents, I think it is so miserable as a about twenty-years-old man. Thus I think we should regard a college student as an almost adult not as a child. So they cannot help being paid such as school fee, rent for the apartment. But they at least have to pay their playing expenses on their own. If they do that, they would be able to realize how it is hard to make money and stop wasting of money.

Secondly, if we have a part-time job, we can not only earn money but also acquire some skills which we canÅft learn in the college. For example, when we work as a Ågtelephone appointerÅh ?calling those who have children and teaching parents how it is important to study. then persuading parents to buy some teaching materials for their childrenÅfs studyÅ|. And when we work at construction sites, we can acquire some skills such as how to paint, the way we can easily carry heavy things and so on. So I think we especially had better have a part-time job which we can acquire some useful skills.

Therefore I believe part-time jobs are important for college students. But of course, we must not forget our schoolwork in our college.
