I agree with this opinion. At first, smoking is harmful for people. Passive 
smoking is more harmful than active smoking. So smokers bother many 
non-smokers. Secondly, the smell of tobacco is very strong. And once clothes 
absorb the smell, it is difficult to remove the smell. It is an offensive 
smell for non-smokers. When I went a restaurant and sat down smoking seats, 
my clothes absorb the smell in spite of nobody smoking. The other day, I had 
another terrible experience. I sat down no-smoking seats, but smoke came 
from smoking seats. And I felt very bad. Smoke spoiled dishes and clothes. I 
went back home and wash my clothes immediately. It was very unfortunate day. 
Regardless of the separation of smoking seats and no smoking seats, smoke 
bothers people. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all 
the restaurants. There is no merit of smoking. Smoke spoils tastes of foods. 
Cook donÅft want this result. In order to enjoy meals, smoking should be 
banned. I donÅft understand significance of smoking. Do smokers smoke for 
relaxation? It is better to find an alternative way of relaxation. Nobody 
benefits from smoking. Smoking should be banned at not only restaurant but 
also all public space in Japan.
