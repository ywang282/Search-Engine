"   It is important for collage students to have a part-time job.

I think if collage students do want to study major subjects they shouldn
Åft have a part-time job. That is because if they learn collageÅfs study
perfectly, they can not have time to have a part time job. But I think some
students can manage to do the two things. Probably, such students will not
be blamed, and they will spend their collage life with a sense of
fulfillment.
A lot of collage students live alone. So they must make ends meet with
money which their parents give them. I think such students must have a
part-time job to lessen their parents
Åf burden. By doing that their parents will be glad.  And some students
have a part-time job to merely gain money to play.(perhaps it applies to
me.) But the purpose most of collage students in Japan have a part-time job
is it. They often say that American students have a part-time job to gain
school expenses, and Japanese parents spoil their children too much.
Exactly I think so. I neither agree nor disagree with collage students have
a part-time job, but I want them to use the money which they earn by
working not only themselves but also their parents.
