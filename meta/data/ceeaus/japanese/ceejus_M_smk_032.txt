I think smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
There are three reasons which make I think so. 
Fist , there is a surely fact that many people want to smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants , many place where they can smoke reduce. We, who do not smoke, hate smoke which is produced by tobacco, and be happy if smoking is banned. But I feel this action ignored their thought. We have to think about people who want to have comfortable time to smoke.
Second I think banning smoking is not necessary. Why reason I think so is that if the restaurant separates its space , for example one is for people who smoke and another is for people who do not smoke ,it is not needful action to ban smoking.
Finally if smoking is banned at all restaurants, some restaurants are against it. Because these restaurants gather people to take them place for smoking. Then they have to other way to gather customers.
I think these three statements is connected. To see these reasons linked, I think smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
