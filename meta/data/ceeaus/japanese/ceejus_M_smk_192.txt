I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants, or s
hould I say that smokers cannot stop smoking at restaurants. They may stop c
oming to restaurants because they cannon smoke! If a restaurant rejects peop
le who love smoking, this lost must be large for the owners of the restauran
t, although customers who hate smoking may come there more frequently. Now, 
there are some systems to divide between smokers and nonsmokers. For example
, some designate time to protect nonsmokers from smoke. We cannot smoke amon
g the time. Others designate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Such systems
 are enough to eat good food and make us comfortable. In fact, in a restaura
nt where smokers and nonsmokers are completely mixed, I cannot stop coughing
. However, when I have a lunch at a family restaurant, I do never conversely
 worried smoke thanks to division.  Furthermore, now the technology to absor
b smoke is developing. This may enable nonsmokers to eat lunch next to smoke
rs comfortably in the future. Taking profit of restaurants into consideratio
n, these steps are realistic and reasonable. If every people can have a good
 time, we donÅft necessarily exclude smokers. We only need to invent good wa
y to divide smokers and nonsmokers.
