I donÅft agree with this statement.
Surely, itÅfs important for college students to challenge and experience many things.
Through having a part-time job, Students often find many important things, such as the strict of the society, how to communicate with bosses, or how to speak formal Japanese language.
And they find the real worth of money by working and earning money by themselves.
Because they got money, they must work hard.
People raise their senses of responsibility through a part-time job.
But, I think, there is more important thing for us than it.
It is a collage life.
As I state above, there are lots of things which are learned from it, so I think itÅfs good to challenge many things, if they have much free time.
But I donÅft think so if they have not so much time.
What are experienced from it are preparations for us and they will help us in the future.
But, in other words, we will work in this society in future, and all of us must experience workings ever after graduating from a collage.
But, studying which learned in a collage is what learned only now.
We have entered a collage and we have chances to learn our favorite things for detail, so we should make the most of our chances.
And in collage lives, if we have what we want to do, such as club activities, hobbies and lessons, we should put them before working.  
We can have a part-time job anytime, so we should do it when we have much free time.
That is why I think itÅfs good for college students to have a part time job, but not important.
