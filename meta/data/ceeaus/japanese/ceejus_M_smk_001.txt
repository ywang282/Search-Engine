 I donÅft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
  It is because I know that those who like smoking feel stress if they are told not to smoking, and to smoke after dinner seems to make them happy and calm very much.
I think that both smokers and nonsmokers should enjoy dinner. I hate smoke of tobacco.  When I go to a restaurant with my friends, we usually choose nonsmoking seats. If I smell of tobacco, I lose the want of eating a little. Therefore, I wish all the restaurants completely separate smoking seats from nonsmoking seats, and prevent smoke of tobacco from leaking out of smoking seats. By it, everyone can use restaurants comfortably.
 However, I have a problem when I go to a restaurant that allows every seat smoking with my friends who like smoking. When I enter it, I manage to stand the smell. I can afford to chat with them. However, as they start to smoke in front of me, I hardly stand it.Å@It is too unpleasant for me to eat, but I sometimes canÅft ask them to stop it. Therefore, honestly, I wish all the restaurants to ban it.
