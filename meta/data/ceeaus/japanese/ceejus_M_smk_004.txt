I agree with this idea. Simply, it is one of grounds that I don't like smoking, but I think there are two reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
First, smoking is harmful for you. For example, if you habitually smoke, you can get a cancer of the lungs easy. And you can get nicotinism, too. By nicotinism, you can be taken tobacco dependence, so you are not able to stop smoking gradually. Because smoking affects your health step by step, smoking should be perfectly forbidden not only restaurants but also daily life.
Second, smoking bothers those around smoker about passive smoking. For instance, passive smoking is harmful for those around smoker, too. It increases by passive smoking that Possibility that you can get diseases such as cancer even if you do not smoke. The trouble is not that much. There are people who dislike smoke of tobacco. I do not like this smell, too. Especially, I am having dinner. This smoke spoils good meals and good times. So smoking should be cut out at all restaurants.  
I can not smoke because my past disease. I hope that smoker aware that there are people who are harmed by smoking such as me.
