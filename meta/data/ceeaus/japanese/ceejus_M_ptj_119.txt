"I agree this opinion because I think that college students should have chances of many kinds of experiences.
There are many kinds of part-time job. For example tutor, bakery shop clue, event staff, cafe shop clue etc.
By experience these part-time jobs, we can learn many skills and get politeness.
People who want to be a teacher can know the way to teach if they experience a tutor.
People who experience a shop staff can learn communication with strangers and get a manner.

And college students do not have uniform like high school students. So, they have to put on their own clothes.  Therefore, they need many clothes and they need a many amount of money. They should be dressed up!! So they should have a part-time job.

Surely the most important thing that college student should do is studying, but, to spend a wonderful school life, we need money. And now we are about 20 years old, we should not depend on parents so heavily. We are about to be independent. 
So we should have a part-time job to make money for our pleasure.
But the thing we must not forget is that we should not neglect studying by too hard working.
