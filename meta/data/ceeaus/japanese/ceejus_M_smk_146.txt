There are a lot of heavy smokers in Japan and they often smoke during eating and after eating. If smoking were completely banned at all the restaurants, they wouldnft enjoy eating at the restaurants. They feel it uncomfortable that they arenft permitted to smoke and donft go to the non-smoking restaurants. Then, people who go to the restaurants are almost only non-smokers. The number of customers may greatly decrease. It is bad for the restaurants. Smoking need not be completely banned. It is better to divide the area of the restaurants into two. One is the area where people can smoke, and the other is the area for non-smoker. This way makes each people come to the restaurants and enjoy eating at the restaurants. It is important for the restaurants that the customers enjoy and feel happy.
