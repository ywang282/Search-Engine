Many people like a cigarette ,and smoke at any place in japan. if only we are over twenty years old, we can buy it in any store easily. Today, while  a lot of them feel relaxed by smoking it,, many people who don't smoke suffer from that smoke.
   The fact is that smoke contains harmful material which cause the person lung cancer . So, to reduce the risk for the smoker, a cigarette is  with a filter tip. But only being by the person who is smoking , even if you are nonsmoker, you smoke passively. Passive smoking is more risky for the human health than direct smoking. 
    But ,today, we have done many things to change this circumstance into that both smoker and nonsmoker get along without feeling uncomfortable. we have separated smoking area from non smoking area. At the restaurant ,office, university, even at the platform , smoking  space is established. Owing to that ,we have not only succeed in reducing passive smoking ,but also many smoker are able to have a chance to reflect on their smoking manner. A lot of thing for smoker and nonsmoker have been complemented, nevetheless now should smoking be banned completely at all the restaurants ?
