In Japan smokers are freer than in other country. In other country, they are banned strictly and they feel that they are not comfortable. People who donft smoke can deny smokers and can say gplease donft smoke hereh. But Japanese smokers donft feel so uncomfortable and other people donft have the right which refuses smoking. Japan should be severer to smokers in every situation. Restaurant is one of the situations. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. In addition, restaurants serve us with delicious foods or drinks. Eating wonderful foods is most precious and happiest time in life. That time must not be spoiled by smoking. Most of people who donft smoke feel smoking very bad. Because of smoking, delicious foods will be terrible foods. Restaurants make our great time and get money by us. Restaurants should consider them and choice the best way to make us happy. Add to this, Japan is behind other advanced country in various manners and view to around problem, environment, global warming and so on. Other country may recognize Japan as developing country in these fields. So, Japan has to renew its society and should be truly advanced country. As first step, I agree smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.
