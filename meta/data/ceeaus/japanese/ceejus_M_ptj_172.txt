"I think that part time job is not important but not bad for college student. It is most important thing for college student to study hard. Student's parents pay much money to college. Student can earn only about 2000 yen per an hour from part time job at the most but parents pay about 3000 yen to college. So student should not skip them class to part time job. But college student is not child. They need more money than parents provide them. For example they want to play with friends, buy books, cloths, games and etc. If they have perfect free time, I think that they can work on part time job. Of course, the part time job should not be too hard to study on next day class. They can not only earn money but also can get some good things from part time jobs. For instance, they can communicate with people out of college. College students hardly talk with people out of college. And they must not be angry with customer to earn money. So part time job make them more patient. The tim
e of part time job give them things that they can not learn from college."
