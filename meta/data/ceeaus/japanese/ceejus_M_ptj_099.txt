"I agree this statement and have three reasons to support my opinion.
We college students have even more leisure time than that we have had in last three or six years. What should we use this much time for?
First, I think that we should use this time to gain some social experiences. For example, volunteer work or part-time job.
So it is good for college students to experience part-time jobs.
Second, of course, we want to use this time to play with friends and take out him or her. And we will usually pay some money to play.
Moreover, college students have a long summer vacation and in that time all of them must want to travel, go shopping or go to see movies and so on. For more exiting summer vacation, we need to save much money.
It is good way to save money to have a part-time job.
Third, we college students should have some responsibility for ourselves.
To have a job or gain money by himself doesn't always fit with to have some responsibility himself. But if something happen in our home, maybe having a part-time job and gain money by ourselves helps us to keep going school.
So I think that it will be not useless for college students to have a part-time job.
That's all.
