I agree with this opinion. Nowadays, smoking is banned at a variety of
places, for instance, at station, hospital, community center and so on.
This means that the number of people who donÅft like smoking is
increasing and public opinion heads toward banning smoking. It is very
comfortable for people who dislike smoking, including me, because we
have not to breathe smoke there. Above all, we dislike breathing smoke
while we are eating, for smoke make dishesÅf smell or tastes bad, so we
should ban to smoke at the restaurant. In my family, my mother, my
sister and I hate tobaccoÅfs smoke, but only my father like smoking very
much. Therefore, we made some rules about smoking not to quarrel. First,
nobody can smoke at the table and everybody must enjoy eating and
talking each other. Thanks to this, we can enjoy our dishes very much.
Second, my father can smoke only in his room if he wants to smoke in our
house. This keeps our roomsÅf air clear. In these ways, we have some
rules that limit smoking and we are in good each other. I think it is
very comfortable for us to enjoy our meal without smoking. We should ban it.
