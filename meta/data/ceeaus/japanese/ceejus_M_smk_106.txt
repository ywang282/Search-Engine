I insist that smoking has bad points but never has good points.
Smoking is harmful for not only smoking people but also people around them.
I think smoking should be completely prohibited, specially in
restaurants and on street.
In restaurant, people eat lunch or dinner.
They enjoy the taste and flavor, but smoke makes their feeling not clear.
This is why, many exclusive restaurants forbid guests smoking.
Nowadays many restaurants in Japan divide seats into smoking seats and
non-smoking seats.
Do you think it is good idea?
I donÅft think it is good idea, because it is unable to completely
separate non-smoking people from smoker.
The smoke enters non-smoking seats area and non-smoking people breath it.
In addition, waiters and waitresses working there canÅft avoid from the
smoke.
I work restaurant twice a week.
When I work as a waiter, I donÅft want to go smoker table.
I donÅft smoke, so I hesitate it.
So I always worry about my health.
For instance, smoke may make my stamina down or make inside my body dirty.
Like this, smoking makes non-smoking people feel uncomfortable.
I think smoking should be banned at restaurant in Japan, even I think
smoking should disappear from around the world.
