"I agree this statement.
 First,having a part-time job gives us ,college students, chances.The
chances are for us learning money is very difficult and hard.Much of us
would not think that getting money is so hard things.Becouse often we
could get money from some relatives easily.Renently I have heard that a
lot of new members of society would retire their company soon.It seems
to me that one of the couses is that they did not spend their school
days om working.If I would not experience working in my school days,I
will be confused the hardness of reciving money in future.
 Second,although it is my individual things, I have a lot of things that
I want to do.For example,trip with my friend,learning cooking and
getting drivers license.But those need so much money for me.So,I should
have a part-time job and I want to use the money that I earned for me.
 Finaly,we have much free time.Probably,It is only college student to
have so much free time.So we should use the time effectively.I think
that one of the means of spending the time on part-time job is so
good.That is why I agree the opinion.
