I agree with this idea. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons why I think so.

First, there are the facts that smoking is bad for our health and that side-stream smoke is more harmful than mainstream smoke. These facts mean that smoking is the problem not only for smokers themselves, but also for non-smokers. More specifically, non-smokers heavily suffer from smoking than smokers. Even if they try not to smoke, non-smokers suffer from harmful side-stream smoke, as long as they are near smoking people.

Secondly, we have to think about what kind of place restaurants are, especially about the users. Many various people use restaurants, including little children, the old, the weak, and people who hate smoking. For such people, smoking is unbearable.

As the result of the above, protecting non-smokers from side-stream smoke is the most important thing, and smokers should always care that thereÅfre many people who suffer from their smoking. 

My idea might sound strict with smokers. But as I know that thereÅfre some smokers who do want to smoke, I donÅft force them to stop smoking, because itÅfs their own responsibilities to decide whether they smoke or not considering their health. If they do want to smoke, they have to choose a proper place to smoke. For example, they can go to a bar where they are allowed to smoke freely without being complained.

In brief, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in Japan and smokers should always care about other people. But some places where we are allowed to smoke should be left for smokers. I believethat this is the best way how smokers and non-smokers can live together.
