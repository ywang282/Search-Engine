 I am against this statement. Some say that the experience is important when we begin to work. But when I ask them to tell me concretely what is important for, they cannot answer, or the answers are trivial. I do not think there is what we can get only through pert time jobs. I think the statement just excuse for the fact that they do not want to work. How many students will write the reports that convince me? I think that they consider great reasons only the purpose of giving in the reports, and write great reasons as if they were sensible. It is nonsense. I wonder they want to do pert time jobs with such reasons.
  Then, when we work, probably we hesitate to use money too much. It is economical, but I think annoying.
  Anyway, I do not mean that students should not do pert time jobs. Some must work for living, helping their families or getting pocket money. I think those who want to do a pert time job do. Though I did write I am against, what I really mean is that I do not want to be told by students who have pert time jobs that I had better do pert time jobs as if I were NEET.
