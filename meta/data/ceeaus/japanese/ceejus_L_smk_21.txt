Smoking is very harmful for people, especially young people and small
children. The harm of smoking has a negative effect on people who donÅft
smoke at all. For instance, cigarettes cause us cancer or some diseases.
This is why they bother the smell, the smoke, and the harm of smoking.
In fact, I hate it that smokerÅfs smoke in where there are many
nonsmokers without caring about the influence of their smoking. Moreover
the harm of smoking affects not only the health of people but also the
taste of people and the flavors of the foods. This effect is always very
bad. For example, the smell of cigarettes changes the smell of dishes.
We go to restaurants for eating some delicious dishes. That is why
smoking in a restaurant improper to an occasion of a restaurant.
Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants in Japan. And, I expect that the opinion realize more and
more early, and then every smokers recognize cigarette donÅft need when
they eat in restaurants and have manors about smoking. If we canÅft
prohibit smoking in the restaurants at all, we should divide a
restaurant into the space where we can smoke and we canÅft smoke.
