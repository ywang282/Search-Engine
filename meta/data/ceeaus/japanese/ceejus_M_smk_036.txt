
I donft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
There are two reasons why I canft agree with the ban on smoking.
First, banning at all the restaurants is too excess.
Now, at many public place smoking is banned, for example the station, on the street and so on. And smoking area is increasing. So someone think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants too.
But restaurants is eating space, and also resting space. Smokers relax at the restaurants by smoking. 
We donft have the right to deprive the smokers of their right to smoke. 
The other reason is that it is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
Of course smoking does harm for our health, and even passive smoking also does harm to nonsmokers.
So think it is better for smokers and nonsmokers to separate space in the restaurant. Then, nonsmokers can enjoy eating without worrying about passive smoking, and nonsmokers can enjoy smoking at the restaurant without about nonsmokers.
In fact, many restaurants have smoking table and nonsmoking table. And I think it is good enough for smokers and nonsmokers to enjoy eating at restaurant. 
By these reasons, I donft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan.
