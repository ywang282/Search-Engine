I agree with this opinion.
One of the reasons for this is that the smoke do harm to personÅfs body,
and what is worse, persons who are damaged by this smokeÅfs influence are
not persons who are smoking but those who are near the smoking person.
In especially restaurants are closed spaces, where it is impossible not
to breathe this smoke.
Another reason, if there are smoking persons near us when we eat, this
smoke would make meal tasteless. Not only persons who feel this smoke
unpleasant, but also those who like smoking feel meal tasteless. This is
because I heard a person who stopped smoking say that after stopping
smoking, he feels meal delicious and he enjoys eating.
This is why, in restaurants, in order that everyone enjoys and
concentrates on eating, smoking at all the restaurants should be
prohibited by the law. If smoking at the restaurants were banned by the
law, someone who was once discomforted by smoking would not have to
worry about smoking in restaurant and would not have to ask smoking
person for stops smoking. And what is the most important merit for this
is that when we eat, we definitely donÅft mistake the ashtray for the dish.
Therefore I think that smoking should be completely prohibited at the
restaurants in Japan.
