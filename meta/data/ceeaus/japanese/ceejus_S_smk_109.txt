Recently, taspo has been introduced in vending machine so as not to make young people smoke. This means that smoking is bad for them. In addition, a smoking man does harm to his near people with secondhand smoke. There are children as well as adults at restaurant. Although many restaurants have smoking seats, the seats and other seats are not separated. As a result, consumers cannot help breathing cigarette smoke. Some consumers at the restaurants hate the smoke. Restaurants are the place where we enjoy eating. For example, if people who donft like cigarette smoke breathe it at a restaurant, they canft enjoy eating and feel very bad. This is a disadvantage for the restaurant and for consumers. If I were restaurant owner, I might hesitate to ban smoking at all seats. Thatfs because when a man who is a heavy smoker comes to a restaurant, he may be angry for banning smoking and eventually never come to visit the restaurant. Then he will go to restaurants that are allowed smoking. If smoking is completely banned by the law at all restaurants in Japan, I donft hesitate to have consumers ban smoking. Smokers will give up smoking at restaurants. Smoking not only gives no benefits, but does much harm. No smoking at the restaurants will have great benefits to many people.
