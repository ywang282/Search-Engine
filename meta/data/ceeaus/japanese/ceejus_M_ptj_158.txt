I agree to the statement that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First, when we are college student, we have much free time. So we can do many things except to study. For example, buy something, go to a trip, play with friends, and get a qualification. And if we want to do them, we need some money. But we should not always rely on our parents about money. We should work a part-time job to get money ourselves to do them. Second, it is very valuable experience for us to work a part-time job. We donÅft know in practice what to do in a job. But we can experience it when we have a part-time job. We will have to choose what to do in the future. It is very difficult and important for us. To work a part-time job may change our view about a job and helpful to choose it in the future. Third, we can practice how to do in society in a part-time job. We need to learn how to do in society. But we can not learn all of them in college. And if we learn them after graduation, it is little late for us. So we need to have a part-time job, and practice them. This is the reason why I agree the statement.
