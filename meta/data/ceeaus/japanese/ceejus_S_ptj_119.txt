I agree with this statement.

This is because college students need to know what working is like.

First of all, I talk about my example.

When I was the first grade at university, I didnÅft have a part-time job.

But now, I am the second grade and have a part-time job, because I want to learn what working is like before I graduate from university. 

At first I was worried and tired, but now I am used to my job.

And I can know how difficult communicating with many people is and know making money is not easy, and so on.

I cannot learn those things from a lecture in university.

Then, I explain why you have to know how working is while you are college student.

Some people say that college students should not have a part-time job because they work too hard to study in a lecture. Of course, studying is very important.

However, will you really need only an academic skill in the future?

YouÅfll work with many people such as co-workers, bosses or customers.

And you have to communicate with them.

Even if you sufficiently have an academic skill, you canÅft work alone.

Recently, people who donÅft have a job have been increasing.

Some people donÅft work though they graduate from a college.

After they graduate from their college, they have a job.

But, they bother about human relations and resign their job.

Therefore, you should be used to communicating with many people while you are college student.

In university, you mainly talk to your friend.

But, if you have a part-time job, you have to contact with many people. 

You can learn from a part-time job how to communicate with many people.

So to conclude, college students need to have a part-time job.
