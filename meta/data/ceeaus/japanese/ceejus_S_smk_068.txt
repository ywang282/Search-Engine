 I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons for this. First of all, the cigarette does the person of circumference unpleasantly. There are a lot of people in a restaurant. Some of them may dislike cigarettes. In Japan, smoking seats and non smoking seats often divided. But it is not enough. When I visited the family restaurant the other day, I saw that smoke of the cigarette move non smoking seats from smoking seats. I feel unpleasantly because I hate cigarettes.
 Secondly, the cigarette spoils the cooking. The smell of the cigarette disturbs a smell of the cooking. I think that the smell is a big point for cooking. If smokers donÅft smoke while eating, they will understand true taste of the cooking.
 Finally, a smoking rate may fall. It is said that the cigarette is bad for our health. Furthermore it does harm to the person of the circumference. I think that healthy people increase if smoker decrease. 
 If smoking is banned at all the restaurants, a lot of smokers and cigarette companies will object very much. But there are some countries doing it in the world, and they have good results. Therefore, I am agreeable in this opinion for these reasons.
