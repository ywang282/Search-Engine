"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job. In many case, a college student lives all by himself. Living all by oneself needs much of money. For example for food, clothes, lighting and heating expenses, rent, travel, expenses. So college students need enough money for life. Of course their parents could send them some money, it is desirable not to get on top of parents. And if college students have a little money, they can not make various activities. There are many clubs in courage. A club is very fun and they can make many friends. For doing club activity, college students should have part-time job and get enough money.
We can not only get money but also precious experience from part-time job. Restaurant, service industry, there are many jobs. And there are various people in office. College students can study many things what can not study in college, for example the method of service, efficient job way. Those things good for everything in the world. In practice, I have worked in broiled meat shop. And I could get enough money and delicious board and good relationship. For those reasons, I agree this idea. Students should have part-time job!
