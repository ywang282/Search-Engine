In my opinion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are four reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.
 First, smoking isnÅft good for smokerÅfs health. By keeping smoking, their condition is getting bad. According to statistics, smoking is picked up as the major cause of lung cancer.
 Second, smokers sometimes do non-smokers harm. By receiving the smoke generated from the smokers. Ordinary people become ill or have lung cancer in the worst case. This is called passive smoking. Passive smoking causes the trouble for non-smokers, especially pregnant women.
 Third, once people begin smoking, it is very difficult to stop smoking. The tobaccos have a nature like drugs. If you always smoking and stop it for a while, you became nervous or feel frustration. And finally, you canÅft endure and will smoke. There are many people who want to stop smoking, but they have great difficulty to get over the smoking.
 Finally, smoking can lead to the safe and waste problems. Throwing the tobaccos away sometimes happens at some places. If smokers donÅft extinguish their tobaccos, the fire may happen. And if they neglect them, the town may be dirty and increase some litter.
 From their reasons, I support the idea of the ban on smoking.
