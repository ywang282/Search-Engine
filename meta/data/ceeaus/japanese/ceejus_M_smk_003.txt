I agree with this topic that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I think so.
	First, smoking is bad for our health, especially lung. Smoking is known as the major cause of lung cancer. Smoking also causes many heart or bronchus diseases. If all the restaurants in Japan would prohibit smoking, the number of smokers, or the number of smoking times might be decreasing, I think.
	Second, some of the nonsmoker spaces are insignificant. Many restaurants in Japan have nonsmoking space. But actually, sometimes smoke from tobacco comes to nonsmoking space from smoking space. It is very bad for nonsmoker because most of they are not like smoking smell. IÅfm nonsmoker, and I hate smoking smoke too. And generally speaking, it is more danger around smokers who have a smoke than smoker themselves. So they hate tobaccos smoke, all the more they are eating.
	However, for smokers, it is stressful that they cannot smoke, and maybe it is bad for their health. But smokers should stop smoking even if they are eating. So IÅfm in favor of this topic. I wish it would come true some day, and other public institution should be banned too, I think.
