Today, a lot of restaurants ban smoking at all tables in Japan. It is very good tendency. Smokes spoil chefÅfs good dishes. Smell of smoke robs appetite of people. In addition to this, smokes make peoplesÅf body illness gradually. Because smokes in top of tobacco are worse than these in end of tobacco, whether a smoker is careful of others or not, he or she never smokes without bothering others. We should not smoke. If that tendency expands to all places, a lot of people will quit smoking. Also population of lung cancer is increasing. This disease is caused by custom of smoking. The more people quit smoking, the fewer death rates are. People who are not over 20 years old are banned smoking. But some of them have habit of smoking. This is due to adults. Adults should watch them not to get tobacco. In order not to get tobacco, its vending machine should be banned soon, and price of it should be high. If government started these two plans, we could reduce population of smokers. I hope that all over the world ban tobaccoÅf vending machine and smoking in all places. I want to see world that no one smoke some day.
