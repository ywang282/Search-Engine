Not surprisingly, we know that smoking has exposed a man who smoking to cancer and others serious disease, because this is often reported by many researchers.

But smoking harms not only smokers for himself but also non-smokers around smoker.

This is called Ågpassive smokingÅh. A cigarette can spread many health problems for many people if people live around smoker.

Nowadays, restaurants in Japan separate smoking seats from non-smoking seats, but it is a fact that how far smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats, smokers and non-smokers are spending times on eating foods and drinking tea in the same building; space. 

From the other point of view, cigarette smokes have peculiar smells, so people who are eating foods in the same room in which the man smokes cannot enjoy the smell and taste of food because of the smells of cigarette smokes. Smoking can prevent from enjoying meals. 

Furthermore, many ashes of cigarette are left by smoking. By an ashtray, most of them are caught, but a little of them arenÅft caught. Restaurant must keep rooms clean, so smoking in restaurant can bother people who use after seat smoker used to enjoy eating foods.
