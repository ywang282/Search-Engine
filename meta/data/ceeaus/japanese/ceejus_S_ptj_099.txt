> job.There are two reasons why I agree that college students have a
> part-time job.
First, we need a lot of money to go outside. For example, we go bowling,
shopping, do karaoke, enjoy parties and so on. If you stay in lodgings,
you will need more money.
So, it is important for us to have a part-time job. Second, we can
obtain a lot of knowledge by working part-time and experiencing various
jobs.
For instance, the way of cooking, servicing, using computers and so on.
When we get a lob after several years, we can utilize this knowledge.
>  Certainly, we can make money by having a part-time job, while we lose
free time for studying and enjoying club activities.  The important
object at university is to study a lot of special knowledge. So we
should think about the balance of three pointsÅ\having a part-time
job, enjoying club activities and studying not to fail to pass on to
the next grade. If you can balance them, you will be able to enjoy
wonderful university life! In this way, I think that it is important
for college students to have a part-time job, but you should have a
part-time job after much consideration.    "
