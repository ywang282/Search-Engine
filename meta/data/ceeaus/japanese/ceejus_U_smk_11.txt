I agree with this statement. There are two reasons I think so.
 
The first reason is that cigarette smoke is very bad for our health. It is very poisonous not only for smokers but also for nonsmokers around them. It is said that the smoke causes cancer and other disease. Actually, I have had a sore throat because of smoke in a restaurant before. I am a nonsmoker, so I think that it is absurd for nonsmokers to become ill because of smokers. Of course, to ban smoking is good for smokerÅfs health.
 
The second reason is that the smoke is very uncomfortable for nonsmokers. I think that people go to restaurants to eat and get contentment. But if the restaurant is filled with cigarette smoke, we canÅft content. And we are puzzled when the smells of cigarette attaches to our clothes.
 
Now we can see the restaurants that separate seat for smoking and nonsmoking to solve these complain of nonsmokers. But this system also has a few problems. The case is that smokers and nonsmokers go to the restaurant together. If they sit smoking seat, nonsmokers feel uncomfortable because of smoke. On the other hand, if they sit nonsmoking seat, smokers canÅft content. It is difficult to satisfy both people.
 
I think society should regulation smoking. In fact nonsmoking is the mainstream in the Western countries. The number of smokers is decrease and they achieve comfortable life. If all the restaurants in Japan ban smoking, we will be able to get healthy and comfortable life.
