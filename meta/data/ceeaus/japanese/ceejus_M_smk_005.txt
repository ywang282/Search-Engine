I definitely agree with this following idea ÅfÅfSmoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in JapanÅfÅf On the country I have the opinion ÅeÅfSmoking should be completely banned in the all public places.ÅfÅf I have some reasons why I think so.
First of all, smoking is very harmful to the health. For example, it is a leading cause of lung cancer. Smoking has a bad influence not only on smokers but also on passive smokers. And the influence on passive smokers is more harmful than the one on smokers. There are many kinds of people who come the restaurant; family, students, old people and perhaps the people who have the allergy to tobacco. If there is only one man who smokes, all people are forced to breathe the smoke of tobacco.
 Secondly, seeing someone smoking and smell of tobacco lose our appetite completely. We go to restaurant to eat and enjoy delicious foods. Smoking in restaurant spoils such thing. For the people who dislike tobacco itself, to take a glance at someone smoking loses their appetite. And smell of tobacco spoils foodÅfs good smell that stimulates their appetite. And I think smoking at the table is very rude for the cook at the restaurant. For smoking makes the sense of taste. 
Thirdly, restaurant is the public place. In the public place there are many kinds of people. Some people dislike tobacco. I think the all thing that trouble other people should be banned in public place.
For these reasons, I agree with the thinking ÅeÅfSmoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.ÅfÅf And I think smoking should be banned in other places.
