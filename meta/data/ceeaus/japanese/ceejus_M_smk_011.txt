From the beginning, I firmly object to smoking.
Smoking do harm to you. For example, it lessen your strength, it has carcinogenicity,
It makes you liable to be hard to recover from sickness, and so on.
The above facts are very famous.
But some young people, especially teenagers, donÅft know the above facts.
Of course a lot of young people know the above facts.
But even these people also donÅft know the real terror of smoking.
In a word, they make light of smoking.
Some people begin to smoke with a slight interest.
Then they come to be prone to be addicted to tobacco.
Finally they canÅft refrain from smoking.
I think that the most serious terror of smoking is secondhand smoking.
If you donÅft smoke but you have the person who smokes around you, you suffer the harm of tobacco.
And to our surprise, the smoke does more harm to the person who doesnÅft smoke than to the person who smokes.
Then there are a lot of restaurant that doesnÅft have no smoking seat or no smoking area.
In my opinion, such restaurants should set up no smoking seats or no smoking area.
Frankly speaking, I think that the statement ÅgSmoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. In Japan.Åh is an excessive enforcement.
