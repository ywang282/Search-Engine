  I agree this theme. Smoking is harmful not only for smokerÅfs health but for nonsmokerÅfs health. Because, nonsmokers expose to passive smoking. Tobacco contains harmful substances such as nicotine. It is possible for smokers and nonsmokers to cause lung cancer.  Passive smoking has a risk of lung cancer. In Japan, when we go into the restaurant, we are asked if we smoke or not. If we say yes, we will be led to smoking seats. If we say no, we will be led to nonsmoking seats.  In a restaurant, although the seats are parted, nonsmokers can smell the smoke. And many families eat at restaurant. Of course they contain children. Smoking has a bad influence on children. Children are very sensitive and easy to be effected by smoking. Many people donÅft like the smell of tobacco. The smell of tobacco is very unpleasant for nonsmokers. If smokers want to smoke in the restaurant, they should smoke outside the restaurant. For example, I have a part-time job at a restaurant. It bans smoking all day. We ask customers not to smoke. So, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
