I disagree with this statement. I donft smoke and Ifm not going to smoke, so if smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, I wouldnft be annoyed at all. But nowadays, smoking is banned in too many places. Ifm a little bit sorry for smokers. In my high school, smoking gets to be completely banned at school when I was a student. Our teachers who smoke were complaining about it. There wasnft smoking area in the school. And even out of the building, smoking isnft allowed. They were smoking in the road in front of the school. I thought that itfs better to make smoking area in the school.

In Japan, the restaurants usually have smoking areas and non-smoking areas. But sometimes the wall between both areas is too small or therefs no wall. Then the smoke easily comes from the smoking area to the non-smoking area. I wonder what the meaning of the existence of the non-smoking area is. That is foolish. A friend of mine hates smoke very much. And itfs true that smoke from tobacco is also bad for people who donft smoke. So if restaurants divide these areas, please let smoke stay at the smoking area.
