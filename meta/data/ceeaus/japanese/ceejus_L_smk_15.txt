I think that smorking must be  completly banned at all the   restaurants in Japan.
The first reason is that people at restaurants want to enjoy gond meal, but smoke hinder good smell of meal.
The second reason is that smoke stain with curtains and sofa of restaurants.
The third reason is that if person are smorking during meal, smorker can not cncentrate on the meal.
Concequently,smorking must be  completly banned at all the   restaurants in Japan.
