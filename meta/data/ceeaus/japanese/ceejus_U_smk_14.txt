    In my opinion, this is not a necessary movement.
    I know there are a lot of people that dislike being around smokers and having to breathe that annoying, smelly piece of air with them. Especially parents are keen to avoid this, so that it might not harm their children. In fact, Ifm one of these people. I hate the smell of the smoke coming from those cigarettes and I donft get why smokers smoke; all it does is happily welcome cancer. So I understand why some people say smoking should be completely banned at most places, including restaurants. What they say about smoking being harmful is true and they have a point. But is completely banning it truly necessary? If restaurants let people smoke all over the place, sure, thatfs definitely a problem. But most restaurants separate smoking tables from non-smoking ones, at some places the smoking area is even separated by plastic board walls and I donft mind the smoke at all; because it doesnft come! As I said earlier, I donft like the smoke that comes from smokers but I have friends who smoke (20 and over of course) and they say they do it to relax or settle down, and I donft mind them because they smoke in places out of harms way. 
    So in this way I donft think that banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan is that necessary, as long as smokers are separated from the non-smoking in a decent distance, keeping their smoke to themselves.
