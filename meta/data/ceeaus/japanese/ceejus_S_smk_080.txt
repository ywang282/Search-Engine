I think that forbidding people to smoke at all restaurants in Japan is  
very good idea. This is because the smoke could make foodÅfs  
tastes bad and a lot of people in the restaurant could be  
uncomfortable. I do not smoke, so I do not understand why smokers like  
smoking and smoke anywhere. And, smoke of a tobacco is bad not only  
for the smoker but also for people who are near the smoker. There are  
a lot of restaurants which many families with small children come in  
Japan. I think that it is too dangerous for children to be in the  
place where it is full of the smoke of tobacco. I heard that smoking  
increases the risk of the lung cancer. In addition, the smoke damages  
passive smokers more than smoker. It is terrible fact.

Now there are a lot of restaurants which have a no smoking seat in  
Japan. Indeed it is a good idea to avoid the smoke. But there are  
smoking seats too. I think that it is not sufficient to save people  
who do not smoke. That is why I agree with that opinion. Moreover I  
request the government to make the rule which forbids people to smoke  
at every public places.
