I donft agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think it shouldnft ban completely smoking in restaurant in Japan. Smoking is not banned in Japan. People have a right to smoke.  I have a friend who smokes. He sometimes looks very hard when he need to smoke. It means smokers have a time when they must need to smoke. So sometimes smokers have a time when they must smoke in a restaurant. So we can't ban to smoke. But I always think it is too bad if there is a person who smokes next chaire. When we eat, smell of tobacco brake the mood and make foods bad. So we should separate the space where who smoke use and who donft smoke use, I think. It is easy thought and very good for each other who smoke and who donft smoke. And I, donft smoke, think it is very serious problem whether can smoke in the restaurant or cannot smoke in the restaurant for smoker. So we shouldnft ban to smoke in the restaurant. We should separate the space where who smoke use and who donft smoke use I think.
