 I think we should completely prohibit smoking at a restaurant. I have three reasons for this.
     At first, we know that smoking is worse than useless. For example, smoking makes strong a possibility we get cancer, suffer from a disease, and miscarry. And the most dangerous thing is passive smoking. Passive smoking means cigarette smoke affects non-smokerÅfs health. Cigarette is harmful for not only smoker, but also non-smoker.
     At second, now smokers have no rule. Only when a law is enacted, they observe the law. They must consider what they should be like.
     At last, I think smoking keeps from communication. For example, when I talk to my friend or family, IÅfm offended by smoking. Because I feel like their being unwilling to hearing me. This opinion depends on a person. But the number of persons who feel like that is not a little.
     These three points are main reasons for prohibiting smoking. So I agree that we should completely prohibit smoking at a restaurant.
