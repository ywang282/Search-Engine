I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job. 
Firstly I will tell you that a part time job give you the money that you can use freely.
Secondly I will talk about that a part time job makes you notice how hard you earn money. 
Finally I will explain that a part time job enable you to use their free time freely.

The first point is that a part time job gives you the money that you are free to spend.
For example, university , especially national university students are poor.
They spend almost allowance or scholarship on the cost of living.
But they can travel and eat delicious food if they have a part time job.

The second point is that a part time job makes you notice how hard you earn money.
For example, they will be sometimes scolded or be taught severely by their boss when they work. They will put up with such pressure and learn how hard they earn money.

The third point is that a part time job enables you to use your time usefully.
For example, college students donÅft have money , but they have a lot of time.
They have too much time on their hands if they donÅft have a part job.
However they learn various things when they donÅft study .   

So, in conclusion, I believe itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job.
