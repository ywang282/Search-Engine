"I think so too, because having a part-time job benefits us. Through doing part-time job we can learn many things we need to learn. 

  The first thing is what we can become polite. When we do part-time job, we have to work as a clerk of a store or company. So, we have to greet, talk to consumers politely.  We can learn the manner which we have to get in the future. If we donÅft have this manner, we could not get job.

  The next thing is responsibility. We have to be responsible for our task, because part-time job is not play. This responsibility is necessary after we graduate from college and when we start to work for company. 

  Then, we can learn how important money is. We do hard works and get money. This hard works tell us the importance of money. It isnÅft until we get money we earned that we realize the really value of money.

  Through the part-time job, we can experience our society and realize what our society is. We can become a member of our society.

  Moreover, college students have much free time. College is not as busy as high school. We college student should make the most use of this free time. It is best time to do part-time job.

  For those reason, I think college students should do part-time job.
