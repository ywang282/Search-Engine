I agree with this statement. We can obtain many things. For example ,manners, sociability and money.  I think that manners and sociability are very important when we will go to society. Especially, money are very important for the college students. In the college student, their are many times but students have little money. When we will be a member of society ,we would have little time. So we had better experience many things within college students. Club activity, travel and enjoy with friends need money. A part-time job available to gain money. The reason of to do a part-time job is to gain money in many people. For enjoy college we need many money. I think that the more enjoy college life, the more succeed study in college school. But our purpose is to study in college, so we must not neglect for reasons of a part-time job. If we can not study because of a part-time job, we must not do a part-time job. I think the only people that study well may do a part-time job. If we note the point of that, we can do a part-time job and enjoy college life. So I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
