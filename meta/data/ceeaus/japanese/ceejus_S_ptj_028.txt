    According to ÅgUriboÅh; this is an information book about Kobe University given us when entering ceremony was held, most of university students start a part time job before summer vacation. That is because once students get used to a life of university, they begin to find part time jobs. I think it is natural that students should start a part time job as soon as possible. It is important for them to have a part time job.
     University students need much money. This is the most popular reason why we have to have a part time job.
 First, we need money to study. We must pay tens of money for university a year and buy many expensive text books. Some students also must buy many books to write reports. Second, we need money to live. Many students live apart from their family. They must pay rent and charge of water, electricity and gas. Of course they must buy something to eat, too. Third, we need money to enjoy a life of university. We have much free time so we often join some club or circle. Or some travel abroad. Each of these costs much money.
  Another reason is that university students should prepare to become one of members of society by experiencing variety jobs. Now we are students but not children. It is meaningful for us to know what working is like. And through working ourselves, we can know the worth of money. Experiences of a part time job will teach us many important things.
