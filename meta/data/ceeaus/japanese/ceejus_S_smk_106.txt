Nowadays, a lot of people pay attention to smoking. Smoking makes some people unpleasant and even unhealthy. So the government makes some rules. We must not smoke in some stores, streets and schools. Especially smoking in store is taken notice. Some people disagree with it, but it is very good for most of us to make it. I think so, too. Because smoking doesnÅft bring useful thing for me. Moreover it brings bad things. For instance, first we spend a lot of money for cigarettes. A person who smokes ten cigarettes in a day spends about 5 thousands yen in a month and 60 thousands yen in a year. Second we also are likely to take serious disease, cancer and stroke, by smoking. This is proved medically. It is very dangerous for not only smoking people but also people who are around smoking people to smoke in narrow place ,for example in store. Third, there are a lot of garbage by smoking. Lastly cigarettes smell very bad. In the narrow store, the smoke is shut down and it smells but much more. If the government makes a rule which ban from smoking on all stores, these things is better and some people may stop smoking. So I agree with banning from smoking on all stores.
