"I think that college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons for this.
Firstly, we can learn what I cannot learn in a college. For example, it is how to cook and a good manner for customers. I worked at Fugetu Kazenomati .Fugetu is okonomiyaki shop. I worked for eight months and learned how to use kitchen knife, how to cook okonomiyaki, yakisoba, tonpei etc and basic knowledge of cooking. I began to live in Kobe this year. In fact, the experience I got by a part time job is very useful for my single life.
Secondly, money is necessary for a college student. There are many events in college days. For example, it is trips, parties etc. these events need much money. In fact, I will go abroad this summer. Of course, there are scholarship and money of my parents. But I want to spend money that I earned as much as possible.
Finally, we meet many people at a part time job. For example, it is members of the job and customers. Now I work a part time job at a sport club. The sport club has many members. I often talk with them. It is very fun and interesting for me.
Of course, we should study hard in a university. But, for these reason I agree with this opinion.
