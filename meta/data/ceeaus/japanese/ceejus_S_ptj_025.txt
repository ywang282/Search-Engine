I agree to this opinion. I think it is important for us to have a part time job, too. I have three reasons for this idea.  
Firstly, a part time job can help us with our independence. When we become college students, we gradually need to be independent of our parents not only mentally but also economically. I think a part time job is a first step of it.
Secondly, when we do a part time job, we can experience many important things that we canÅft experience in our campus life. For example, we can learn manners, human relationships and the way of working, in the real world. We can have an opportunity to understand the mechanism of society.
Finally, the experience of a part time job can be useful when we will get a job in the future. I think a part time job is also a practice of work.
Therefore, I think a part time job is important for college students. 
However, study is the most important for students. We should spend a lot of time in study. We shouldnÅft stop studying because of a part time job. It is important that we keep good balance of study and a part time job.
I donÅft have a part time job now, because I am busy with study and club activity. I want to have a part time job when I will get used to my campus life.
