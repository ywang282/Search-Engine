"I agree with that statement.
First, I think college students including me have at least one or two ambitions that they can do only
when they are in college. For example, traveling around the world in long vacation, buying clothes or
car, etc. To do that, they must have a lot of money. I think it is not bad for college students to
have a part-time job to get money.
Second, for the college students whose school is far from their parentsÅf house and who lives alone
near the school, all things costs them directly. If their parents have a lot of money and give them
easily, they don
Åft have to have a part-time job. But if their parents have not so much money, they have to have a
part-time job to get money to buy food, textbook, etc.
Of course, I disagree to have part-time job that make college students not to study satisfactorily. At
least they are college students, their studying costs their parents or them. They have to study hard
and they have to get good work.
According to these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have s part-time job, and
I agree with that statement.
