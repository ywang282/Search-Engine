IÅfm in favor of the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job.
 First, I think that it is a perfect chance to learn to fit into society. Anyone must become a working member of society when they graduate university. The world is not easy to live in. But they are not able to know the real world only at the university. They can get knowledge that is not acquired at the university only after they experience the world.
Second, college students need money. Many students do club activity, and it costs money in many cases. For example, I belong to a mandolin club. I want to buy a mandolin only for myself. But it is very expensive. I canÅft ask my parents for money help. I must buy a mandolin with my own money. Furthermore, students have much free time. They often play with friends, and spend time for their hobby. It also costs money.
Third, Many students lodge apart from their parents when they become college student. Some must earn money because they canÅft count on the money that their parents send them.
College student is an adult, and they should become independent without dependingÅ@on parents. I think that schoolwork and a part time job are compatible.
 For the reasons stated above, IÅfm in favor of the opinion that it is important for college students to do a part time job.
