At present, some strict rules about smoking have been established by this country and autonomies. For instance, there are regulations that people underage may not smoke and every people must not smoke in the street except admitted smoking lounges. WhatÅfs more, smoking is not permitted in the train stations and the inside of a taxi, not to mention the hospitals. Then, why arenÅft smokers completely banned from smoking at all the restaurants?
 Since people who care much for his health have been increasing, issue of passive smoking come to the surface in recent years. The restaurant is a place to enjoy meals. If cigarette smoke hang over you when you enjoy your meal, it may difficult for you to feel nice smells and flavors of foods. And you are bound to breathe in cigarette smoke as you take foods in your mouth.
 Though you have restaurants which you can choose between smoking table and nonsmoking table, cigarette smoke come in nonsmoking table through smoking table at almost all of the restaurants. In brief, it is no use dividing smoking table from nonsmoking table and setting up smoking room. I suppose that smokers should tolerate to smoke at least while he is at the table.
