It is important for college students to have a part-time job.

     I agree this opinion. I will explain why I agree it. ÅeExperienceÅf , I
think it is the most important and precious thing for younger generation.
Think about university students, most of them had not worked from small age
to 19 or 20 years old. Because they have to enter famous university, so they
study and study every day. Only they do is Åestudy on the deskÅf.
     But after they graduate university, most of them must be work. Now I
run a small company, I think people who canÅft think by themselves are
increasing recently. Their style of thinking is one way. They donÅft know
that there are various kind of people in the world. They only know their
small world, family or friends. It is a serious social problem.
Å@Å@Å@And another problem is there. About 40% people who are just out of
university leave their company within three years. Most of them say that the
work does not different one what they think about. Or they do not feel
interests about their work. They think the job is not fit for them.
    Of course Åepart-time-jobÅf may take time from them. The problem may
occur. Some students do only work instead of their study.
    But, ÅePart-time-jobÅf for university students will give them precious
experiences and many important things. They will learn about the structure
of  world.  And they will feel how difficult to earn their own money.
ÅePart-time-jobÅf will give them many presents.
