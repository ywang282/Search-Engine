I agree with the opinion that it is important for collage students to have a part time job. I have a few reasons for this in terms of economy and society.
First of all, collage students need more money to live or spend for leisure than before, so a part time job is the best way of earning money easily and quickly for them. If collage students, such as who live on money which is sent from their parents, donÅft have a part time job, they cannot keep on living when sending money is stopped. Also, they can reduce their parentsÅf burden to send money once a month by having a part time job.
Second, I think that having a part time is learning the importance of working and responsibility. Collage students must work with responsibility in society in near future. In this regard, working part time is very meaningful to them as a means of learning society.
Finally having a part time job enables collage students to make relationships with many people who are different age or have different thoughts from theirs, and by this, collage students can know different values.
For these reasons, I agree with the opinion that it is important for collage students to have a part time job.
