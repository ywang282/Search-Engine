I think that college students should a part-time job. Of course many people think the important thing to be study for them, and I think so. It is the situation that they should avoid that study becomes negligent by a part-time job. 
It is a thing to get money at the cost of own time and work force to a part-time job. I am tired and lose it until time that is one's freedom when I work too much it.
However, they can know society by experiencing it and can grow up mentally. I can obtain a lot of ability by touching the people whom I met newly at a new place. This has many things that are not obtained by the study. 
In addition, the income of a part-time job is very important for rooming house students. Because it just turns into their food. They may become the situation that cannot get the supper of the day if they do not earn money by a part-time job by oneself.
Therefore I think a part time job to be an important thing for college students.
However, they should not forget that study is the most important. Because it is oneself to be troubled in the future if I neglect study.
