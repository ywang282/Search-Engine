I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Students not to join club activities, especially not to study hard, are bored everyday. If they feel bored, they should work. They lead meaningful lives and get money by working. 
In fact, I have not had a part-time job since last November. I am bored everyday. But, I donÅft have too much money to enjoy with my friends. 
Recently I feel that I have led useless time. If I allotted those useless time to working, I can buy what I want and enjoy dinner, trip and bowling with my friends. 
I think that I can improve myself in new environment. In addition, a part-time job may be useful when we graduate from college. We will understand what kind of thing working and getting money are by a part-time job. And we can make new human relations by a part-time job too. 
But I think itÅfs not good that I neglect study by working. So I think the best is proper working.
For these reason, I agree with the statement that it is important for students to have a part-time job. And, I want to have a part-time job soon.
