Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I agree with this idea. There are three reasons why I canft agree with the ban on smoking.
First, I donft smoke because I hate this smell. When someone smokes, I feel sick and my clothes get annoying smell. I canft bear this smell, and its state. 
Second, perhaps this may be a prejudice that smoking people donft have good manners because smoking seems to be bad manners in Japan. So I consider someone smokes at restaurants to be a nasty.
At last, smoking does harm not only smokersf health but non-smokersf. My mother would not smoke but in her office some people are heavy smoker. So she is a passive smoker. She perhaps will get a lung cancer in the future. I think that this behavior is a crime. Needless to say I strongly feel that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
However, I think that it is impossible to be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I want to insist it is the truth that someone really hates smoking like me. So I want them to think about non-smokers. To keep good manners make good circumstance, I think.
