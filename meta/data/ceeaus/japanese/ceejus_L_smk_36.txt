Nowadays, in Japan, smoking has come to be controlled gradually. For
instance, a less than 20-years-old young people cannot buy a cigarette
with vending machine without ÅeTASPOÅf. In addition, smoking has come to
be banned at some places. Those are only because smoking makes your
health worth. So it is also natural that smoking is completely banned at
all the restaurants in Japan.
    For other reason, a restaurant is a place where enjoys cooking and
is not the place where enjoys smoking. The main purpose of go to a
restaurant is eating a delicious dish. However, not only you but also
one of the surroundings will surely think that the taste of the dish is
unsavory if you were smoking when you go to a restaurant. These
days, in some restaurants, a smoking seat and a nonsmoking seat are
separated. However a person who do not smoking may be guided in a
smoking seat if the restaurant was crowded. If it becomes so, the person
will become a very unpleasant feeling.       If smoking is completely
banned at all the restaurants in Japan, everyone could enjoy a meal.
Those who want to surely smoke should just smoke outside a store after
having a meal.
