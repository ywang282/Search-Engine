Å@I agree with the statement. Because, I have had part time job since July, I thought that this will be good for me in the future.

  I work as a staff of various events on my holidays. Then, I meet a lot of people in a day. At first, I donÅft know a way of speaking and behavior. But, through my part time job, I learn a lot of things little by little. When we become a working member of society, we will have to meet and speak with all types of people. Then, ability to communicate will be needed for us.

 And I have heard before that young people of the day donÅft have an ability to communicate with others older than them. So I think it is important for young people to be used to communicate with others in different generations and different conditions, so as not to be thought that. 

  Anyway, I think it is important for young people to experience various things. Part time job is a great opportunity to experience to a lo of kinds of situation and learn a lot of things. So I think it is important for young people to have part time job.
