I agree with this opinion because it teaches us how hard to get money. I hadnft had a part-time job before I became a college student. So, if I had something to want, parents gave me money as gokodukaih and I could go shopping. I didnft think seriously that how long my parents work hard to make the money when that time. However, since I began to work part-time, I got to know that making money is not easy. I donft have enough rest in working time, scolded by owner when I make a mistake and they make me very tired. Moreover, all of the money I earned is spent soon in my daily life. Then I feel I mustnft waste money. 
 Most of college students have to get job and live by themselves after a graduation. So I think it is need to know how hard it is while we are college students. Because I actually experienced working and I find it is harder than I imaged. Having a part-time job is one of a good way to know about working.
 Thatfs why I agree with the opinion itfs important for college students to have a part time job.
