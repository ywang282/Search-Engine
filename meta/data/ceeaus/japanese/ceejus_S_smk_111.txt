Now that both smoking and second-hand smoking are well known as the major cause of lung cancer, all the smokers should try to quit smoking.

Many people hate a smell of the tobaccos, and the smell gets some people to feel terrible.

A friend of mine in Nagoya also gets stomachache just to smell the smoke.

In fact, the case of me, I donÅft get bad feeling by smelling the tobaccos and itÅfs not that I hate smoking. To tell the truth, I like a smell of smoking very well.

But much of my friends donÅft like it and I know the news of lung cancer, so I will not smoke again forever.

Besides, I think, smoking interrupts.

For example, when you have a dinner time surrounding good smells, the nice meal will be destroyed and we will feel as if the taste of good meals will drop down because of the smell. 

Of course I want to eat the dinner at a good environment for having meals.

Exactly itÅfs up to us whether to smoke or not, but we have the duty to provide other people with the comfortable environment. We never annoy someone.

This thinking is close to the concept negative externality in economics.

In other words, just because a smoker has the time to smoke tobaccos outside the restaurant, people having the dinner inside the restaurant get the nice meal and smoker have the chance to smoke openly. So utility of all the people will maximize.

Therefore smoking should be banned inside the restaurants, but should not be outside the restaurants.
