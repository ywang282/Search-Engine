These days, many college students have some part-time job. I have a part-time job, too. So, many college students think that it is important for them to have a part-time job. College students need money to buy books, to buy grocery, to commute school and so on. I live in myself in Kobe. I can live enough with money which my parents send me, if I donÅft use money too much. But, I often short for money while my parents send me money, because I would like to buy clothes, CDs and so on. In fact, I donÅft need them really to live by myself. So, I have to earn money by myself.
 The idea that college students have a part-time job has cons and pros.
I think one of the advantages is that we can earn money to use freely. College students want to do many things. For example, shopping, trip, getting a driverÅfs license, and so on. But, often our parents are against us, and they donÅft give us money for those things which we want to do. We have to earn money by myself, and we can do that we want to do.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. One of them is that we may be not able to have enough time to study. College studentsÅf task is studying. But if we work for too long time, we canÅft study enough. ItÅfs not good for college students, because we have many things to learn.
We should learn to use time and money wisely.
