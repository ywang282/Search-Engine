I donft think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

Now, in Japan, 26.8 percent (man: 41.3 percent, woman: 12.4 percent) people are smoking.

In economical side, if these people do not enter restaurants, restaurants would have a big loss

Some people say that if they do not ban smoking in restaurants, non smokers wouldnft enter restaurants.

But restaurants have already restricted smoking.

They set up seats for smokers.

All restaurants do not set up it, but almost major restaurants set up it.

In addition, they set time, when people can smoke or not.

For example, in lunch time (11:00~14:00) all seats (include smoking seats) are banned smoking.

Restaurants concerned guests.

Thus, restaurantfs attitude is not to ban smoking.

As long as someone legislates that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan, restaurants will not ban smoking in restaurants.

Restaurants choose profits.

Restaurants provide a lot of comfy equipments for smokers and non smokers.

I think just a few cheap judgment non smoking people yell efsmoking is too bad!  So smoking and smokers should be exterminated!!ff

So I think they canft completely ban smoking in restaurants in Japan in economical viewpoint and they donft have to ban smoking by force.

Because there are demands.
