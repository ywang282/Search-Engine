I canÅft agree this idea.

 

To be sure, smoking may be very troublesome for those who are not smoking.

But I think that a little it is an excessive idea.

Because this troublesome be solved by advancing dividing the workplace into smoking and non-smoking sections.

I feel a cigarette no merit, and although I dislike the smell of a cigarette, a motion of the latest society seems to be cold in smokers too much.

I have a feeling that smoking is not so bad.

Probably, most smokers have the preparedness at the sacrifice of their life by smoking.

Some people may not have it.

If it is right, what problem is there when they think manners and smoking so that trouble may not be made to us?

It is the cause of those who do not consider manners and it is very sad that even smokers who really love smoking receive cold treatment.

 

If only a restaurant is forbidden to it, a smoker may try to finish a meal in other place other than a restaurant.

 If it becomes so, only the restaurant industry will receive damage and it is also sorry it.

 

I think for smokers more kind policy should be made.
