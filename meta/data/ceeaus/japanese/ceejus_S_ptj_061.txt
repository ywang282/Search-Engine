"　I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time
job. There are several reasons.
　First, college students need some money, for example having lunch or
eating dinner with friends. Although studying is the most important
thing for college students, having a good time with friends is also
important. Students enjoy playing with their friends everyday.
　Second, a part-time job brings up college students. By working,
college students learn social skill, manner, and common sense. A few
years later, all the students will be required such things. College
students must practice by working as part-time worker.
　Third, a part-time job is the important chance to make friends. In
fact, my coworkers and I are good friends. Talking with the seniors is
very interesting. I enjoy part-time job with them.
　Fourth, college students should know the importance of the money. No
man wastes the money that he earns. To learn the use of the money is
very important.
　Thus, I think that college students should have a part-time job. A
part-time job needs a lot of time, but that is never futile. There are
some people who don't have a part-time job. If they start working,
they surely grow up in various aspects."
