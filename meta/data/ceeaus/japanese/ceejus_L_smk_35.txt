In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan. The reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for health and if someone smokes not only themselves but also surrounding cause damage. If someone smokes near our place, we damage more than the person who smoke. Furthermore, there are a lot of children in restaurant. If the children breathe the smoke, the suffering is not only harmful for health, but also crimping the growth of them. We must protect them from the threat of smoking. 

 According to the statistics, the person who is smoking is much more likely to have cancer of the lung than the person who is not smoking. Thus, smoking has no advantage and a lot of disadvantage. But in Japan, there are a lot of places which allow people to smoke. It is hard for the person who is not smoking. We must decrease the number of those places. So we should prohibit smoking at the restaurant as one part of decreasing the number of smoking place. It is hard to prohibit smoking all the places but we can gradually decrease such the place.

 In this way, to prohibit smoking at the restaurant protects the person who is not smoking from the threat of smoking.
