I agree with this statement. Because, I think that we can learn important things when we do part time jobs. One reason is the following things,we can learn the true meaning of teamwork in almost all the part-time jobs. And Teamwork is useful when we have a job,because we can't work without using that,many tasks are not accomplished one person's effort ,and before work we need to learn about that,and need to know how important that thing. Second reason is that you get your own money. You can spend freely. Your hobby is more exciting things. And you can trip many places with using that money, trip may change your idea or your identity. Other reason is that we can know various type of people. To know various type of people may lead you to the success of getting well of your boss or your companion. You talk with various people ,you may become good listener ,and,of course,you become good speaker,you do not be able to learn that in school,become a good speaker or listener ,you must have more and more friend's .If you become good friend's , your daily life become more and more good thing,and your college life will be more enjoyable thing!
