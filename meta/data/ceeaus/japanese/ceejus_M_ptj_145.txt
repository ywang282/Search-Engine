"I think that it is importantfor college students to do part-time jobs.
First this is because they have to spend much money for
playing,traveling,club activities and so on.If they don't spend money
for playing,they will need a lot of money for commuting to university.
If you were a high school student,your parents would pay the cost when
you want to buy something.But college students should not depend on
their parents so much,and they should try to lead independent lives. Of
course,I don't insist that it is bad for themm to receive economical
supports from their parents.I just want to say that it is important for
them to earn money,even if the salary is low.
Second this is because they can't waste their own salary.They can learn
how difficult people earn money by doing part-time jobs.So when they
spend money,they think carefully whether the cost is proper or not.The
difficulty of earning money prevent them from wasting money.
Third this is because doing part-time jobs is the practice to be a
respectable member of society.They will understand the rule of the
society while they are working.college students are generally regarded
as adults.So they have to contribute to the society.Doing part-time jobs
is the large part of college students duty.In order to enjoy the college
 life they have to work hard."
