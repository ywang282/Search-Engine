I agree with this opinion. I have three reason for agreeing with it. First, College students use a lot of money. When we become a college student, we need more money than before because we come to have a large circle of acquaintances. But our parents do not always give us money.Å@So, we should do a part time job and get money. Moreover, we can understand the value of money. 
Second, we can experience the world. If we become a working member of society as soon as we graduate from college, we will suffer great hardship. We can get used to being a working member of society. 
Last, the experience of doing a part time job is very useful for the future. For example, if we do a part time job tutoring students, we can explain very well.
You may say that we cannot study so much if we do a part time job. But we can become good at juggling our time. Furthermore, we always spend free time on study.
So, I agree with this opinion that itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job and I am going to do a part time job as possible.
