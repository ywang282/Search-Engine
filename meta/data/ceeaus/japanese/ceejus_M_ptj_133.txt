I think it is important for college students to have part time job.
This is because we can get precious experience from the part time job.
The experience will help us to find the job that we want to do.
For example, my part time job is mathematics teacher in cram school.
I like the job because teaching math makes students and me smart.
I feel happy when we become smart.
And I get happier when I hear thanks from my students.
This is why I have become want to be a cram school teacher.
And other reason for having part time job is money.
We need much money for enjoy our school life.
If we donÅft have our own money, when we have dinner with girl friend or boy friend, we take a trip with friends and we take place a party with our circle friends, we canÅft take part in there.
But we need also time.
We must study and make report like this.
I think it is very important and necessary for college students to have part time job.
But I think it is most important for college students to balance between part time job and studying.
