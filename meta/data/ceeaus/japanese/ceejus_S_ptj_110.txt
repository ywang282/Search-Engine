"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.

Since college students must learn relation of society, common sences,

And communication skills. They are needed incredibly after graduation

Of the colleges. To explain his or her companyÅfs production or ideas

To cooperative companies, communication skill is absolutely needed.

On the other hand, common sences is needed whether students will

Work on company or not. No one can live alone. So, needless to say,

communication and common sences are very important to all the people.

But I think they are learned more in workerÅfs relations than in college 

StudentÅfs relations.

For example, when I worked on IZAKAYA--Japanese bar-- , I missed 

The form of cooking, then co-worker who is older than I became angry,

But thaught me the correct form of cooking kindly. On the one hand,

When I came there lately, the owner came to me and told me the importance

Of keep a time in society. And I still remember the words. 

In college students relation, It is difficult to say the miss and to tell the

Caution. But in workerÅfs relation, one can say the misses and caution him 

Or her.

So I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.
