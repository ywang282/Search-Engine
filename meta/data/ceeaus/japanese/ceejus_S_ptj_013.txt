I disagree with this idea. The reason is three. First reason is that college students are busy in studying. Taking rest is important for college students. Second reason is that if college student get money by having a part time job, they play and do not study very much. Third reason is that the young who experience getting money easily may think that they can live on a part time job and lose will to study.
Someone says that much money is needed to buy books. But college student can use library in university. Books rented in library are needed to come back to library. So we do not stop reading books which we rent in university. Another says that they shouldnÅft rely on their parents. But, I think that college studentÅfs parents hope their children concentrate on studying while they are scholar.  Another says that working experience is important for the young. But, in this society a part timer canÅft do important thing. College students are cheap worker for employer. What is important is not earning little money while they are college students but studying hard to earn big money in the future. So I think that the idea Ågit is important for college student to have a part time job. Å@
