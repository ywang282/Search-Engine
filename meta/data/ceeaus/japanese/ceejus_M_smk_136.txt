I agree with this idea.  I say about the reason why I object about smoking in the restaurant concretely. 
First, many people enjoy eating their dish in the restaurant. Some people in restaurants, cigarettes smoke makes dish bad taste. Its smell is bad.   Approximately non smokers donft feel comfortable. For instance, my experiment said that smell have me be irritated because I couldnft concentrate on the taste. Maybe many non smokers think same that because my friend talked to me about similar thing. 
Second, recently people have been interest in their health. But cigarettes smoke harmful. It is said that the smoke brings about cancer and many disease. In other words cigarettes smoke does harm our body. Some smokers try to quit smoking because of the fear of illness. Moreover Passive smoking causes non smokers illness. They are smoking unconsciously in the restaurant. It is very dangerous situation. So we must change that.
Third, now there are many smoking banned spaces in Japan and it has been increasing. In addition that smoker canft smoke almost all public spaces such as train station and concert hall. Of course, restaurants are public space. All things considered, all the restaurants in Japan should disable smokers to smoke.
