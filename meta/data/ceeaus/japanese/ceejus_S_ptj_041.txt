I agree with the opinion.  First, doing a part time job enables college students to learn something that they cannot learn at the university.  For example, how difficult working is, what the WORKING is, the importance of the money, rules of the society and so on.
 Second, earning money helps college students to be independent from their parents.  College students are old enough to earn money.  So, they should help a family budget.  Because, they will have to keep their family budget, near in the future.
Moreover that must be good experience to do the compatibility of part time jobs with studying to university students.  
 Of course, the first thing college students have to do is studying.  So there is a balance that should be kept between studying and working. And you may say "University students should spare their precious time to do what they can do only now, for example, studying harder or club activity and so on."  Of course, that is right.  But I think doing part time jobs is also what they can do only now. To do part time jobs helps them to choose their jobs in the future.
 So I think it is important for college students to do a part time job.
