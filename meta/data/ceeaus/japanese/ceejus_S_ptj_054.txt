I agree with the following statement .

First , the college students will have to work to live  and be independent on their parents after the graduation ( though some of them wonft do so ), so it is good that they prepare for working and independence . One of the means of it is a part-time job . In short , they should have experiences of working . 

     Second , there are those who start to work after they graduate the high school , but on the other hand , the college student donft work . That isnft plain . You say that , however , the college students study hard , so they donft have to work . I think so . In these days , what they do are the club activity , shopping , playing karaoke , talking in the cafeteria , and playing other activities that donft bear fruit for society . I think most of them go to college because they donft want to work . Those who have profits are only themselves . They should work for society .

Third , in Japan , oho donft a child must work , but the college student donft work . Though they donft have to work , they should protect their principle .
