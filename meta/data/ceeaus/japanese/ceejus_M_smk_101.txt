To smoke does harm to you. To smoke makes your lung black and you become a lot of disease. Practically, when you compare smokers with non-smokers, smokers die than non-smokers the cause of cancer of lung and throat.  Since smoking is very bad for your body, I think that to smoke be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.  There are a lot of people in the restaurant. So smoking does harm not only to himself but also to them. It smells bad. As a result, non-smokers are also equal to smoker in smoking. So many restaurants are divided two seat types, for smoker and for non-smoker. However, when I went to the restaurant, smokersÅf seats were vacant and non-smokersÅf seats were filled with people. Not only visitor but also restaurant loses in many ways. Perhaps, there are people who say, ÅgI canÅft live, if there no tobacco in my life.Åh They should smoke out of the restaurant. They should know that they do themselves harm and give trouble to a lot of people. Finally, I think they should stop smoking. Then, all the people become healthy and happy. I sure to that . So I disagree with smoking in the restaurant.
