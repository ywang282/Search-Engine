I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I think smoking should be so. 
First, I donÅft smoking and donÅft like smoking. My father doesnÅft smoking, too because he was hospitalized with a disease ten years ago. He stops smoking to be careful about health. Some my friends are smoking but I think they stop smoking with me.Particularly, when we have lunch together, I think so, too.
Second, Smoking is very smoky and bad sell. Some people that are not smoking feel unpleasant when some people are smoking in the same restaurants. In such a situation some people that come to the restaurant to have good dish can not have good dish.
Third, Smoking gives not only a smoking person but also the person whom there is around bad influence in them body. Now smoking is banned at many public places, train and bus because passive smoking is known as the cause of lung cancer.  I think that some people that are not smoking do not want to go to the restaurants that there are some smoking people and a parent having the child does not want to go there.
