The position of college students in society is on pre-adult stage. So student can have many chances to know society. Doing part-time job related to work in the future. If students have pert-time job, he or she may discover his or her potential capacities and develop their ability. Moreover they might know what they want to do in the future. Knowing society means touching movement of society. For example, when I had part-time job at the factory of Kappazusi and saw various frozen foods, I think that foods which we eat everyday come through human working. I was surprised. Where did these foods come from? How did this drink reach to me? Around our life, there are many products. Even if the goods isn`t handmade and made from machine, somebody would be concerned in the process of production. Then, I consider what I can do and what I should do for having the job.

 And a part-time job gives students practical good things. That is wage. It is important to use the money earned themselves, while they compare two worth: their effort and the good which they want to buy. I think that money from income of parents differ from the money of themselves too. After little years, they will get only themselves profit. So, they can practice the management of money. They can understand difficulty of getting money and living by themselves.

Lastly, in school life, student experience many important things. There are communication and cooperation. Though, part-time job may expand their world. It is job outside their school that gives special feeling; responsibility, happiness, and achievement, and another position to student. The environment around people affects their sense of values and way of thinking. I agree.
