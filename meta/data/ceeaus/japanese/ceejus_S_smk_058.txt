I agree with that statement.
First, smoking has bad effect on our bodies. Once we smoke, it makes hard dependence. And they say
smoking causes many cancers or any other sickness. It is said that   smoking is dangerous for not only
smoker but also no smoker. Some people say smoking is more dangerous for no smoker being near smoker
rather than smoker.
Second, restaurant is place we eat dinner or so. We enjoy it not only taste but also its smells or
looks. When we feel smokes and dinner at the same time, interest to our dinner may be lost rapidly.
Smoking makes bad feeling for not smokers but no smoker around them. It is a common thing, smoker
smoke carefully, but smokes go to no smoker and make bad feeling.
Third, if we make smoking space in Japanese restaurant, we must install machines that let smoke and
dirty air go outside of the restaurant. That costs more expensive than making no smoking space. In
Japan, it is extending to decrease smoking people. It is not necessary to built expensive restaurant
against Japanese present tendency.
According to these reasons, I agree with that statement.
