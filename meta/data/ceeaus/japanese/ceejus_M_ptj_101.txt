" agree with the statement ÅgIt is important for college students to have
a part-time jobÅh.

First,recently I often think that college students need a lot of money
every day.Especially it is because I am from Wakayama and now live alone
in Ojikoen,Kobe City.So I need a lot of money to lead my college
life,compared to leading my college life commuting from my local home to
a callege.For example,every day meals.Unlike eating at local home,I must
manage to eat all meals by myself every day.Although college meals are
relatively reasonable,every day,every meals,I often find that my wallet
is getting small and thin.Or,the money to company with friends or
seniors.I belong to acapella club,and members of the club love
karaoke(of course,me too),so we go to karaoke very often. Similarly, I
often find that my wallet is getting small and thin.then I become sad.

Second,by working in a real society,we can experience various things.For
example,if I work as home teacher or juku teacher,maybe I will learn a
difficulty in teaching in the way that the student understand
clearly.Or,if I work at restaurant, I will learn a difficulty in cooking.

Because of these reason,I agree with the statement.
