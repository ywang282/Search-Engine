"I think part-time job is important for college students for several reasons.

First, college students have to spend so much money, for example, buy train or bus ticket, play with their friends, make meals, and buy clothes, books, and so on. So they must make money by themselves.

Second, they must learn how hard we earn money so that they will not be in trouble when they become working members of society. Most students were given pocket money by 18 years old which their father or mother earned. So they do not know how hard we earn money and how important money is.

Third, if they have part-time job, they will make friends with their collegues. Their collegues will give some piecies of information to them about other part-time jobs, various works, and other colleges, and they will be able to have connections. If they make friends with their collegues, their life will be good and happy.

Last, part-time job is the best way for them to be able to realize what is work and how they work efficiently because college life is the term when students are preparing for the real work.

So I think college students should work as part-time workers
