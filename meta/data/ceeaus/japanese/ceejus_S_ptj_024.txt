I think it is basically good for college students to have part time job, but it isnft always important. 
College students can learn many things through works in our society. At that point, to have part time job is good and students have good experiences. 
 It has, however, some bad aspects as well. First, after all, college students have to study. Having part time job, some students come to be so busy and tired and canft concentrate on classes. Secondly, they get money and may become to use them roughly. Moreover, having part time job, they tend to come home late. Their lifestyles become irregular, especially about students who live alone. There are some bad things like this. So college students donft have to have part time job.
If they have clear aims and can overcome above considerations, for example, to save money in order to study abroad or to live by themselves in the case their parents canft give enough money, having part time job is important.
Thus we canft always say that it is important for college students to have part time job. Students must consider whether they really need to have job, whether they can keep healthy lives, and why they want to have part time job.
