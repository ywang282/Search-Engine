I think that although smoking is bad for not only smokers but also someone around smokers, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for several reasons. First, restaurants are the places where people can rest and so they are able to smoke in the restaurants. Second, these days smorking areas have been too separeted, for example, in planes, in work places, in the Shinkansen. So if restraurants have a smoking area, people can smoke in the smoking area. Third, smoking is a kind of drug. This means that smokers cannot help smoke a lot of times a day. So we have to allow to hold smokin areas in the restaurants. Fourth, I think smoking should be rather completely banned at all the streets in Japan than restaurants. This is because in the restaurants people who do not smoke and are not in smoking area are not annoyed by smokers in smoking area, and smoking in the streets is very dangerous. For example, someone behind the smoker cannot help breathe smoke which the smoker exhale, someone who pass by the smoker can hurt his or her hands ,or his or her clothes can burn. So smoking in the streets should be banned completely.
