I agree with to do part-time job. Certainly, studying is the most important thing for students. But I think that it is important to do part-time job. There are many reasons to think that. First, we university students need money to spend full campus life. For example, we enjoy circle or club activity, study abroad, and buy textbooks with spending much money. Second, part-time job teach us a lot of rule of society. To earn money is difficult. So, it makes our spirit strong. Because of this, we must be responsible for our job when we do it. If we have a trouble in our job, we must not escape from there and we should make efforts to solve it. And part-time job teach us correct way of talking. So I think that part-time job is the best practice for a full-time job. Third, we university students must independent from our parents gradually. When we were high school students, we are totally dependent on our parents for food, clothing, and shelter. But some university students live alone. Then, they canÅft eat foods cooked by their mothers. Earning money to do part-time job is one of way to independent from their parents. 
 So I think that it is important to do part-time job for university students.
