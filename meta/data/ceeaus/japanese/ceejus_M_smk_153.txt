There are many people smoking at a restaurant in Japan. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons I think it. First, smoking give not only mans who smoke but also who donÅft smoke unhealthy effects. It is called passive smoking. Especially children and expectant women are given very bad influences by smoking and passive smoking. At a restaurant even if there are smoking lounges, people who donÅft want to smoke may breathe smoke from cigarettes. They will feel so bad and may lose their appetites then. But if people who smoke heard these talks, there would not be a lot of people who decide to stop smoking at a restaurant at once. So I think that smoking should be completely at all restaurants in Japan to protect people who donÅft want to smoke. Second, to make smoking lounge needs large place to divide between smoking lounges and nonsmoking seats. In there are many restaurants which canÅft prepare large enough to make them. Owners who manage those restaurants have to build smoking lounges near nonsmoking seats. It is more and more possible that people who donÅft like cigarettes breathe smoke from them by passive smoking. So government in Japan should make laws which ban smoking at all restaurants.
