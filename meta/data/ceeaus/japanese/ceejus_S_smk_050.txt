I really dislike smoking.  It is because not only it smells terribly bad but also it is bad for our health.  I cannot understand the people who smoke though they have already known the fact that smoking does harm to our body.  I also cannot see the reason why some people smoke while they are eating.  When I eat out, I make it a rule to choose aÅenon-smoking seatÅfas I can.  This is because I feel that smoke of cigarette makes dishes not delicious.  With the bad smell, I cannot enjoy their real tastes, and moreover, it sometimes causes me a headache.  Eating is one of my happiest things, so I donÅft want to be interrupted by anyone like this.  However, even if I eat something in a non-smoking section in a restaurant, I sometimes smell smoking from a seat in a smoking section.  It maybe causes because the air in the restaurant stays still and the fresh air cannot come into the room.  It is the restaurant that is to blame for this situation.  So if they cannot deal with this problem, they should completely ban smoking at all the restaurant.  I couldn't agree more with it.  What is more, I hope that smoking is banned all the restaurants in the world, not only in Japan.
