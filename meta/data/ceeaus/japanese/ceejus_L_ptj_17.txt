I agree to this opinion. And I have two reasons.

Firstly, part-time job is good experience for college students. I think that part of college students had never worked in their life . Therefore I think that college student should work to acquire social experience . 

Secondly , I think that it is important for them to earn money by themselves . 

I think that it is not necessarily bad to depend on parent . However, I think that it is not good to depend on parents for all money that they need by their college life. I think that they must absolutely experience to earn money for their future .

But , doing part-time job has not only merit but also demerit .

For example, if a college student works at a part-time job too much, they will seldom go to a university. College students must study . And they must have gone into the university, in order to study. Therefore, the college student has to give top priority to study . They should drop out of a university if they do not study. And I think that they should work . It has a merit and demerit to work part-time job in this way. I think that the college student should work at a part-time job if it judges synthetically.
