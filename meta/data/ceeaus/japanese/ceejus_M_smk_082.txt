Many restaurants separate nonsmoking and smoking seats recently. But they mostly are divided a room in two without a wall; non-smokers must share the same air with smokers. If a man takes a smoke after eating, though he is blissful moment, other customers who start to eat are displeased by smell of cigarette. While the smell from the dish is very appetizing, that from the cigarette takes away their appetite. Especially customers are eating at the seats next to smoking become sickening. For cook, it is pleasure that people eat with relish.  

And in restaurant many families come to eat. So inevitably, there are a bunch of children. In terms of education and health, it is wrong that people smoke in the places that gather children. Smoke of cigarette contains nicotine and tar. As they cause a cancer, parents should keep a child off it. 

By the opinion above, at all restaurants in which various people eat should be completely banned.
