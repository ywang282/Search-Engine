I agree with this statement. One reason is that I think restaurants is the place where family with children enjoy eating the meal, and smoking have bad influence for children. Most parents with children always think about children's growth, so think that influence, most parents don't want their children to smoke in their life. In the second reason is smells of cigarettes spoil the dishes in the restaurants. When a dish carried, at fist you feel from the dish is an appearance and smell, if the restaurants should not be banned the smoking , people do not enjoy smelling the dish. And third reason is that smoker's tastes become funny, and become dull. Sommeliers do not smoke , because taste become not sensitive. So people who smoke do not enjoy feeling true the true taste of dishes in their life.
