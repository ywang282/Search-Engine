I agree with this statement. I have some reasons for my opinion. 

First, restaurant is a relax space for many people including me and those people may hate smoking. In fact, as far as I know, almost all of my friends feel unpleasantness, when other person smokes around them. As a result of this, there are nonsmoking seats in many restaurants. And people who donÅft smoke often take nonsmoking seats. Therefore, the cigarette smoke will start going from the restaurant of the hated person in which it can smoke to the restaurant that has stopped smoking even a little.

Second, it is too bad for everyone to smoke. If you smoke over and over, you would have illnesses such as lung cancer. In addition, it gives badly and smoking affects other people negatively. Other people breathe in secondhand smoke, and receive a more awful adverse effect from the person in question who is smoking the cigarette. This will not be a problem of the smoker himself alone.

Smoking the cigarette as understood from these damages not only I but even also other people. It is likely to become the customer's saving a little by stopping smoking in the restaurant digging into one's purse of smoking the cigarette moreover. 

Anyway, it should make it to no smoking of smoking because it is not good.
