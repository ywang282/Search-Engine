"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons is that college students have to earn money than ever before. For instance, they have to buy a lot of textbooks which are expensive and they have to wear clothes which are not uniform Monday to Friday and so on. So they have to have a part-time job to earn money. And main reason why I agree with this statement is that they can go through various things in part-time job before they get a job. I had part-time job in spring vacation. I worked as a clerk in gift shop. The shop sold gift of Sumo Tournament in Osaka. I experienced a lot of things in the job. Since Sumo is Japanese traditional sport, a number of foreigners came the shop and asked us about use of goods in English or Chinese and so on. So I couldnÅft speak foreign languages but I had to tell them as a clerk. Each time I explained to them with gesture.

To speak with gesture is a first experience for me and this experience would not go through without I worked the shop. I experienced any other valuable things. I think that they can learn by a lot of experiences through part-time job. Therefore I really agree with this statement. Å@Å@
