I agree with this idea.

The reason as ground for my opinion is that considering all benefits of smoke, smoking in restaurants isnÅft good but only harmful for people who donÅft smoke.

For people who smoke, smoking in restaurants and cafeterias may give them relaxing and good feelings. It may be natural that when they eat lunch and want to take a rest, they think they want to smoke. And because cigarettes include addictive drugs (nicotine and so), many smoker cannot live without cigarettes.

But, we must check that basically, smoking injure with not only smokers themselves but also people who donÅft smoke. 

When one person smokes, people around him who donÅft smoke are likely to absorb more harmful cigarette smoke.

Besides, restaurants are places where people eat lunch and supper.

Smoking in such places indicates that one person makes people around him eat cigarette smoke.

I canÅft imagine how much eating cigarette smoke does harm with people.

And, if ever people of restaurants divide smoke area with no-smoke area, cigarette smoke float. So anyway, no-smokers will be injured.

As far as this fact exists, Smokers must not consider their enjoyment and pleasure but the existence of no-smokers.

Restaurants are places where everyone utilizes ,so to speak, public spaces.

Smokers who use them donÅft have to think only themselves.

So I agree with this idea.
