I think this opinion is right. There are three reasons for it.



Firstly because, when college students have a part-time job, they can
experience various things that they could not experience at classes. For
example, they exist at a convenience store not as customers but as
clerks. So they will be able to think of things from a new way.



Secondly, it is important for college students to conscious earning
money by themselves. Many of them did not have a part-time job when they
were high school students. So they depend on their parents too much.
They have to become independent from their parents in the near future,
so they should have a part-time job and prepare for independence in
their mind.



Finally, they can realize the importance of work in society. They should
learn to be not consumers but producers. I think a part-time job is good
text to learn the social system. For example, a part-time job at a horse
racing stadium tells them that the horse racing is held by not only
horse and jockey but also other many people. They should use the ÅetextÅf
and learn society before graduate from college.



For these reason, I agree with this opinion.
