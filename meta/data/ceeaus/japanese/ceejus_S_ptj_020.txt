Generally speaking, Japanese college students donÅft have much money.
So it is necessary for them to prevent from spending useless money, and also to gain money.
Therefore, I think that college students never go without a part time job.

Of course, the main object of going college is to study, learn, or master some academic things, called that get the knowledge 
And a part time job robs students of much precious time to study.
However, this fact cannot mean that college student shouldnÅft do a part time job, because, we never study or learn things without money.
If you are willing to study something, what do you do at first?
You may take pencils, books, table, and so on.
Everything you need is not free!!  We should ÅgbuyÅh them. So we, college students need money.

But, I donÅft refer about the most important thing to study something.
In my opinion, it is the heart of the students. 
The students with wonderful hearts-sincerely, purely, smart, etc- can see many facts and understand the things more deeply.
Then, how can we get such as wonderful heart?
I think such the heart grows up in the human community.
Judging from this point, a part time job doesnÅft prevent but help us studying.

Studying is not only reading the books and answering the quiz!
Should we think what true meaning of a part time job and true knowledge is?
