I agree with this following statement. Actually, I have two part-time job, restaurant and
Kateikyousi. If I did not have a part-time job, I could not live by myself.
I have two reasons. The one reason is that my parents spent a lot of money helping me to enter the college I wanted to study in. In addition, I borrow a room in Kobe because it is impossible to go to school from Wakayama, my country. It also costs very much money. I donÅft want to bother my parents any more. So, I agree with having a part-time job, rather I think that we should have a part-time job. Today we have scholarship system.
By this system, a lot of students pay their own cost for college from their earnings. Of course I use this system, too.
The other reason is that we can get many abilities, experiences and so on. If we know only things which we learned in our college, we will not be useful when we will graduate from our college and start to work. I do not want to be that person! Everybody has to think so.
I agree with having a part-time job, and I recommend my Kouhai to have a part-time job. I want a lot of student to agree with my opinion.
