I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons why I think that.
 First, I think it is important that the college students earn money and live their own life. Many of the college students are helped by their parents. It is hard for them to help their children because they have been helping their children since they were bone. So I think the college students must lighten their parentsÅf load. It is one of the ways for independence.
 Second, part-time jobs are useful for studying social life. Many of the college students will work after their graduation. They should practice the way they work through a part-time job, I think. It is important to know what is working and how hard they earn money. IÅfm sure that those experiences must be treasure in their life.
 Now, IÅfm working for a bar. It is so hard, but I always think that it is necessary for my life. When I take pay for the part-time job, I feel so happy. So I will last the part-time job.
 For these reasons, I think that it is important for college students to have a part- time job.
