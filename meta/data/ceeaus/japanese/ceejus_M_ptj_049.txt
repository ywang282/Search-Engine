 I donÅft agree with the statement; it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
 I think, itÅfs important for students who are interested in having one, but not for all college students. Indeed, having a job in oneÅfs early time can be a good experience for his/her full-time work after graduation or his/her dairy life by learning social rules and communicating with other people. But, for ones who donÅft direct to part-time jobs, including me, working can be worthless or even painful because part-time jobs are instable in situations, working places and colleagues, on part-time job students can earn less money in contrast to his/her contribution, and at the largest point, students are fully busy in college lives.
 Many college students must do homework and come to university for a long way. They are also expected to do extra studies before and after lectures. So they have a little time to spend freely. A part-time job spends his/her precious time. In fact, I have only 9 lectures a week now, including 4 lectures with homework, but I have time for my hobby only on Saturday and Sunday. Even then, of course, I have to study so that the length of the free time depends on the contents of the lectures and homework.
 Certainly there are students who have some time and students who are attracted in working on part-time jobs. People like them will have a good time with their colleagues and customers, a pleasant of earning money, and so on. I donÅft deny the people getting them with their own wills. But I think itÅfs not good to force all college students to get part-time jobs, telling that they must be good for them. Weather having a job or not should be decided by studentsÅf own.
