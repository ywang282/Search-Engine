I agree that smoking is completely banned in restaurants. First of all, it is clear that smo
king makes human bodies unhealthy. Especially, passive smoking is even more harmful than inh
aling smoking. Since a number of people usually stay at a restaurant for long time, they are
 forced to receive passive smoking. For instance, though restaurants separate no-smoking are
a from smoking area at present, non-smokers must often sit down smoking area in case custome
rs in the restaurants are crowded. It is beyond reason.  Secondly, children and elderly peop
le are included in those who take advantage of restaurants. Smoking has any bad influences o
n them such as growth, some illness, and so on. These influences may bring them to fatal sit
uations in life. It is natural that restaurants should avoid it. Thirdly, generally speaking
, societies as a whole tend to reject smoking. For example, the number of smoking area has d
ecreased. It is illegal to smoke with walking in these days. It is based that a lot of non-s
mokers are uncomfortable with smoking. In return, smokers who want to quit smoking have rece
ntly appeared. For instance, the goods for no smoking are sold well.
This is why smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants.
