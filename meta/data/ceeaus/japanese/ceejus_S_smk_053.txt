Smoking makes many people unpleasant in a restaurant. Because of
smokers, some people do not enjoy having dishes. At the most of the
restaurants, efforts to protect customers for smoke are not enough and
even if the efforts would be great, we could not completely extinguish
smoke. Though smokers may insist that they should have a right to smoke
freely, the right must be restricted for a lot of people. And
restaurants are not the place to smoke, but to enjoy having a meal.
Managers need to realize a restaurant that all people can enjoy a meal.
 That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan has
another good respect. To prohibit people from smoking leads to decrease
chances to smoke. Of course, in a bus, train, taxi, smoking is banned.
Like restaurants, as the number of places not to smoke is larger and
larger, the number of people who smoke is smaller and smaller. It is
very good for smokers to give up smoking. It is so bad for our body to
smoke. For instance, our brain does not work well, our bone become weak,
and smokers will die earlier than people who do not smoke.
 This is because to forbid smoking is a great means for both smokers
and non smokers.
