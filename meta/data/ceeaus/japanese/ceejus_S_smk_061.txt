I disagree with this opinion. 

It is true that cigarette smoke sometimes annoy another person, but completely banning on smoking at all restaurant is overdoing.

When I had dinner with my friend who smokes, he said ÅgI want to smoke terribly after eating. Most people who smoke feel like this.Åh This remark reminded me that people who have smoking habit often go out of the restaurant in order to smoke after eating. I also remembered that many people use smoking area if the restaurant has this. These facts convince me that his remark is true. In Japan, there are many people who have habit of smoking. So if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, many people feel ill at ease.

I have another reason. I think it is desirable that there are various types of restaurants .This is because the more types of restaurants there are, the more people can choose restaurants to their satisfaction. They should be able to choose high-class restaurants and low ?class restaurants. In the same way, they should be able to choose restaurants where they can smoke and where they have to refrain from smoking. We should not reduce their choices because it is oppression to do so. When we want to eat dinner without cigarette smoke, we can choose restaurant where smoking is banned. This is also choice.

Therefore I think there can be restaurants where people can smoke.
