"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons that I think so. First, to do a part-time job is very good experience for us. We can acquire a lot of abilities by doing a part-time job, for example, cooking , conversation and so on. These abilities must be useful when we graduate college and start to work in society. Second, we can make a lot of friends with. We can also meet a lot of people who are older or younger than us. By meeting such people we can acquire a manner to come in contact with people. Third, college students have a lot of free time. If we do not have a part-time job, we cannot spend the free time efficiently, and our college life will be very boring. As a result we will spend our precious time only playing. Finally, by doing a part-time job we can feel pleasant of earning money by myself and feel the value of money. Till now we depended our money on our parents ,so we can not feel such feelings. Judging from such reasons, I think that there are a lot of good things to have a part-time job. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
