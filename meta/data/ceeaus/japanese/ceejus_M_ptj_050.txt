I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons for my opinion.
I think that we have good experience by a part-time job. This is a reason that I begin to start a part-time job, because I think that this is very good social study. My part-time job is restaurant .I thinks that experience of the service industry is useful for an occupation of future.
I think that a burden of parents decreases. Actually, I use my salary of part-time job for the cost of living and I donÅft get some money by my parents. I think it is easy to use my salary and use various things. We can travel abroad and study various things, buy likely things by my salary.
The last reason is very personal reason. I belong to baseball club. Baseball club costs money. For example, we go to the camp in every spring and summer. A baseball articleÅ@is very high. Uniform, spikes, a glove are more two hundred yen. Many my friends belong to various circle. Some circle costs money, too.
I think that we should have a part-time job, because if we want to do various things at college students, we need much money.
