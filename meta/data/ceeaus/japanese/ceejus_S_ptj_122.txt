I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, they need much money to lead a college life- Playing with friends, for example, eating, shopping, and activities in a circle and so on. They mustnÅft rely on our parents. They can stand their own legs and can lighten the burden on our parents by earning money. They will realize how enjoyable it is to earn money on their own and to buy what they want by using it. Second, we will probably belong to a company or an organization after they graduate from a college. But, if they wouldnÅft have immunity to real society, you would be embarrassed and at a loss, when you begin to work. That is to say, in advance by experiencing how real society is they can prepare for working, and smoothly receive it. Third, they will have many skills by doing a part-time job Service skill, for example, office work skills education skill, cooking skill, and so on. Such skills would give them much benefit when they work in a company and in their life. However, doing a part-time job too much has a bad influence upon their study and as a result    upon their life. It is necessarily very good to properly have a part-time job.
