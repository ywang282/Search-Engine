I agree with an opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think it is necessary for college students to make money they need for living and they can use freely. They study what they want to do as an adult by themselves, so they cannot put their families under a burden financially. And I think it is also necessary for them because a part-time job is good experience to work in the society. They do not know what is working in the society, so having a part-time job is a very good opportunity for them to know working in the society. I think a part-time job is important for college students to make human relations. If college students do not have a part-time job, they cannot make human relations other than in their colleges. Making human relations is also important for them when they work in the society, and the people whom they met in a part-time job may become important in their lives. I think that a part-time job is important for college students to make money, but there is really important purpose in the future when they work in the society. So I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
