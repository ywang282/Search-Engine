"I think it important that college students have a part-time job. 

Now, I work at hotel. I serve meals at the wedding party and the normal party mainly. I have to do not only serving meals but also many other things. For example, we have to prepare the parties and polish glasses and so on. I have a lot of things to memorize. So, I am tired from the part-time job. But I experienced many important things. They are very fresh for me and I learn them for the first time. Moreover, I canÅft learn them at school. If I continued this job, I could become a person who pays attention to people. IÅfm sure that I can be kind to people. ItÅfs one of the important things I think. In fact, a man who started this job earlier than me can pay attention to people. When I went to a restaurant with him and my seniors, I noticed that he paid attention to everyoneÅfs drinks. I respect him.

Certainly, for college students, the most important thing may be to study hard. Of course, we must not forget to study hard. However, having a part-time job when we are college students is great experience. Therefore, I think that not only studying hard but also having a part-time job is important for college students.
