I agree the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

 

I think that we enjoy not only taste of food but also a smell of food between meals at the restaurants. A smell of food is important for meals.

Smoking give bad influence on other people.

When other customer are smoking, non-smoke customer can not appreciate a smell of food because of passive smoke in the air. Non-smoke customer may feel that even the taste of food is different. Besides, it is possible that passive smoke in the air made us lose our appetite. I also have experience like this at the restaurants. Moreover, passive smoking is harmful for our health than active smoking.

Passive smoke in the air makes a mess of meals at the restaurants.

 

I think that it is not necessary for smoker to smoke at meals. If smoker want to smoke at meals, they should go outside the restaurants and smoke to their heartÅfs content. All customers have the right to appreciate meals at the restaurants. I think that we should take this right into account.

 

For that reason, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
