I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job. 
Firstly, almost all of college students have not enough money. They need more money because they want to play, eat, and buy many book and clothes, so itÅfs important to have a part time job. If they have a part time job, they can get more money they can use freely.
Secondly, having a part time job gives students the good experiences. To sell products or to meet various age of people is different from they experience in college. If they get this kind of experience during they are college students, when they get a job after graduate college, this experience will take important roll in the area of their job.
Finally, I think new skills they will get if they have a part time job will become a treasure in their life. For example speaking well to many people and working quickly when itÅfs need and so on. These are important skills in their life. 
For these reasons, I think itÅfs important for college students to have a part time job and IÅfll get it soon.
