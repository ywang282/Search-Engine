 I think that itÅfs important for college student to have a part-time job for three reasons.
     Firstly, we can meet many persons through jobs.  We spend the major part of a day attending lectures or talking with our friends at colleges.  However, once we graduate from own college, we need to associate more persons than now.  In order to get along with them, itÅfs necessary to have great extent of thinking because everyone has different way of thinking.  Meeting many persons is good for it.  For example, my cousin worked as a salesclerk, a teacher and so on.  She met many persons and learned their way of thinking.  Now, she works as a tour guide and makes most of what she learned.
Secondly, we can experience many kinds of jobs before we choose own job.  I think that to choose own job is one of the most serious decisions through the life.  People who quit their job often say ÅgThis job doesnÅft fit me.Åh  If we experience many kinds of job, weÅfll know which job is agreeable to us.  The number of people who quit job will decrease and weÅfll be able to choose job with confidence.
     And finally, we can be economically independent from our parents to some extent.  When we were high-school students, we were expected only to study so our parents paid our school expenses.  Now, we can study, work and earn money.  Sooner or later weÅfll have to pay our cost of living.  Before we stand on our own feet, we had better start to pay it as a preparation.
     For these reasons I think itÅfs important for college student to have a part-time job.
