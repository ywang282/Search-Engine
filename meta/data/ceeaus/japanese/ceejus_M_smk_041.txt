I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons for my opinion.
 First, smoking is harmful not only for smokerfs health but also non-smokerfs health. Many people move in the restaurants every day, of course both smokers and non-smokers. It is unlucky for non-smokers to absorb smoke at the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants is inconvenient for non-smokers. If staffs of the restaurants and smokers recognize that smoking at the restaurants is harmful for non-smokers, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
 Second, smoking could ruin smokersf sense of taste. Smokers move in the restaurants to eat delicious food, but they canft eat them in the best condition. Cooks must want their customers to have their works in the best condition, but they canft.  If cooks really want their customers to have their works delicious, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
 I donft like tobacco very much. For non-smokers, smokers and cooks I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking cannot help anyone, I think. The all restaurants should be the place where everyone enjoys eating delicious food, I think.
