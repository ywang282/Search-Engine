"Å@I agree with the statement. I think college students should have a
part-time job. First, it is true that a part-time job prevents us from
studying, but from part-time job we can learn much more about society,
economy, and how people feel when they communicate with stranger that we
never learn at school nor club activities. For example, it is very
difficult for staffs to satisfy customers while they may take it for
granted to be dealt with kindly at a fast food restaurant. Employees
have to act with responsibility during working, which skill is not
gained so quickly. But in order to be an adult making society better, we
have to be at least responsible for anything about ourselves.
 Second, we can have wonderful friends by having a part-time job. In
fact I started a part-time job at a fast food restaurant this spring.
During the job we have to speak gently, make smile and do tasks speedy
and accurately. After the job I am always hungry and exhausted.
Nevertheless the reason I want to continue this job is the members of
stuff. They encourage me, and make me feel to be like them. They are
very important for me to get over the hard jobs.
 We will get out into the world after graduating Kobe University and
have to take some actions in order to make the world equally more
peaceful. In another words, we need to know widely about this society
and this world. A part-time job is a good method for us, college students."
