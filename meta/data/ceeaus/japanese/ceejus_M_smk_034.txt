I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
It is painful for the people who smoke to be completely banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But, frankly speaking, I donÅft like cigarettes. I think that many people donÅft like cigarettes too. When my mother smokes, I become angry and say her to stop smoking or go away. Thus, in the restaurant, some people donÅft feel good, if anyone is smoking. Moreover we have meals in the restaurant. So we may feel much worse. 
As a personal opinion, smoking should be completely banned at not only the restaurant, but also all places. I think that smoking gives us no advantage. Instead smoking is bad for our health. Besides I learned that smoking does harm to people around a smoker than the smoker. It is really annoying for nonsmoker. Frankly speaking, I think smoking is the same as a waste of money. In addition, we often see that someone toss away a cigarette stub by the road. For the above reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all places. But, considering smokerÅfs feeling, I want smoking to be banned at least at the all restaurants in Japan.
