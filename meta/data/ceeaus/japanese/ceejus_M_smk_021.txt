I donÅft smoke but I donÅft hate smoking. But I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons for it.
Firstly, the men who dislike smoking are unpleasant. Smoke will flow to non smoking area if there are smoking seats and non smoking seats in the restaurants. After all, troubling people is bad.
Secondly, smoking do harm to people who donÅft smoke. It is good to injure smoker itself but not good to harm non smoker. And passive smoking is possible to get cancer people who are around smoker. Especially, for babies this is a big problem because smoke influence development of babies. Smoker shouldnÅft smoke in spite of obstructing development of babies.
Thirdly, smoke is dirty. Smoke dirty food and the atmosphere at the restaurant and produce unpleasant smell. Restaurants are the places at which people enjoy eating food and talking. Smoking is opposite for this. ItÅfs a pity that smoke dirty dish which cook make hard. 
Thus smoking trouble many people. It is not bad to smoke. But smoker should smoke after they think people who around them and place.
