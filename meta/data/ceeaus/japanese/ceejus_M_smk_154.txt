I think that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in Japan.

Recently, I often hear the word gnonsmokingh everywhere. I think that smoking should be forbidden at place where a lot of people are because the cigarette smoke affects our health. Even if we donft smoke a cigarette, our bodies receive the harm if there is a person who is smoking a cigarette around us. Above all, it is said that children are more likely to receive the harm, and there are many children in restaurants. There are a lot of harmful things we receive by smoking cigarette or breathing cigarette smoke from the cigarette which the person around us smokes. 

There are some people who donft like the smell of cigarettes. I donft like it, too. People go to a restaurant to enjoy eating dishes. I think people enjoy the smell of dishes, too. If a person smokes a cigarette in a restaurant, people who enjoy eating dishes around there couldnft enjoy the smell of dishes. 

 Of course, there are many people who smoke cigarette. Such people would have troubles if smoking is banned at all restaurants. But there are many people who donft smoke cigarettes, too. I think people who want to smoke cigarettes have to smoke outside.
