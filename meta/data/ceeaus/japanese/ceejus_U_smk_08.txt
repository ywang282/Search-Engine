Recently, the number of restaurants which prohibits smoking has been increasing. This 

is because the idea that smoking is bad for not only smokerfs health but also the health 

of non-smoker around smoker spread widely. But there are still many restaurants 

which are not prohibits smoking completely. In many restaurants, manager separates 

the seat for smoker and non-smoker. However, air connects to non-smokerfs seat from

 smokerfs seat. So, even if the restaurantfs manager separates smoker and non-smoker, 

smoking makes all people in the restaurants feel bad. Imagine if you are a non-smoke

 and go to restaurant to eat dinner. In the restaurant, there are the seat for smoker and 

the seat for non-smoker. Of course you sit in the seat for non-smoker, but the seat for

 smoker is a little away from you in the same room. You can look tobaccofs smoke and 

smell bad. In this condition, you canft eat dinner pleasantly. Smoking makes the dish 

taste bad. Smoking troubles customer like this. Also smoking troubles restaurantfs staff.

 They have to snuff tobaccofs smoke when they ask smoker the order or when they carry 

dishes to smoker. Since they snuff tobaccofs smoke many times everyday, the risk of 

diseases related to tobacco is higher for restaurantfs staff than other people. Thus,

 smoking in restaurant is trouble for other customer and its staff. If smoking is 

completely banned at restaurant, customer can eat delicious dishes, restaurantfs staff 

may live long, and also it is good for smoker. Thus smoking should be completely banned 

at all the restaurants.
