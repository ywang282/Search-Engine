Recently, the situation of smoking have being changed everywhere in
Japan. For instance some places have rules that prohibit walking people
from smoking. Thus, it is important for us to increase or decrease
situations of smoking. Generally, in Japan, people are banned to smoke
in public places. Then, we need to consider about not public places, for
instance restaurant. I donÅft agree with the opinion that forgives people
to smoke in restaurant. First, there are many family and many children
in restaurants. It is more dangerous for them to breath passive smoke
than general smokers. Second, seats decrease. It is likely filled up on
Saturday and Sunday, so we should remove smoking seats. Third, I donÅft
like cigarette at all. A smell of cigarette is too bad for me, and the
smoke is very harmful, so I dislike it.
Most important thing I say is that smoking is very harmful for smokers
and those around of the smoker. Smoking leads to lung cancer mainly and
other disease. Lung cancer may leads to death, so smoking leads to
death. Smoking has a harmful influence all people, so it must abolished
in restaurant and other places not only public places. I do hope
non-cigarette society soon.
