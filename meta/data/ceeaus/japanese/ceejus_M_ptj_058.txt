I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. Now I will show you some reasons.
Firstly I help my parents to pay my school fees. I give my parents some money every month. So they are very happy. I think I should help them even slightly because I was brought up by them.
Secondly it is important to earn money I spend for myself. And it is necessary to do anything about myself. I like to drink and smoke so it takes much money. I like music so I buy many CDs. So I need much money. 
 Finally it is important to try to go out into the world while college students. I can learn many things. For example, human relations, social system and so on. I work at bar five day a week. So I learn service and cooking. These are very useful.
On the other hand, some people may say I can not study for long time because I have a part time job. But I think it is important to do both of them for college students.
In this way I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.
