  I think that all restaurants should forbid their guest to smoke, for
smoking makes non-smokers annoyed. Furthermore, it influences badly
people around smokers (especially children, elderly people, mothers who
give their children milk, and so on). For instance, it causes cancer. A
report shows that people whose husband or wife smokes have several times
more opportunities that they have cancer than those who is not so.
Smoking also causes other diseases. To make it worse, sub-smoke that
non-smokers have is more dangerous than main smoke that smokers have.

  Smoke that comes from cigarettes makes bad smell when smoke is put on
clothes. And it is difficult to remove it. The smell is as strong as
there are many cleansers that specialized in cigaretteÅfs smell. Some
people hate this smell. It is one reason why smokers are hated.

  Now, many restaurants divide smoking area and non-smoking area. For
instance, in one Moss hamburger shop, smoking area is divided from
non-smoking area with a door. So smoke cannot enter non-smoking area.
But there are some troubles. Closing completely means that smokers have
not only main smoke but also sub-smoke. It is very dangerous!.

  Thus, smoking in restaurants has many troubles, so I am for that
restaurants prohibit it.
