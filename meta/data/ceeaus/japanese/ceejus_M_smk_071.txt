I agree with this opinion. In a restaurant, those who smoke bother a lot of people very much. A certain happening made me realize it when I was working part-time as a clerk in the restaurant. It is the following. 

One day, a family that includes a baby was eating. However, a man sitting next to them started to smoke. Then, the baby began to cry very loudly. 

By the way, smoking in a restaurant is a nuisance from the view of hygiene. When I am working part-time as a clerk in the restaurant, I often see that cigarette ash come out from an ashtray and is scattered on the table. Especially in summer, more cigarette ash is scattered by the wind from an air conditioner. Cigarette ash is more likely to get in the dishes.

In the first place, the cheapness of a cigarette in Japan causes the number of smokers in the restaurant to increase. By making the price of a cigarette very high, foreign countries are making an effort to decrease smokers. Japan should also make an effort to do so. Japan introduced the ÅgtaspoÅh system, but it do not mean to decrease smokers. Decreasing all smokers leads smokers in a restaurant to decrease.
