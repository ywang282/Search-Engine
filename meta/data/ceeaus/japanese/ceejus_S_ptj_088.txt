"I agree that college students have a part-time job.  It is true that they have less time to study what they are interested in due to having a part-time job. So they canÅft study enough. But I donÅft necessarily think so. This is because they can learn a lot of things, which they canÅft learn in colleges, and communicate many people through a part-time job. Furthermore they can buy books, clothes and other things by having a part-time job. For example, if you work at a restaurant, you can learn a service and cooking. If you work at a remover, you can strengthen your muscle. So the more occupations they experience, the more things they learn. Besides, what they learn through a part-time job is far more useful than what they learn in colleges. The money which they earn by a part-time job enables them to do a lot of things. For instance, they can go to class where they learn how to use a personal computer. And they can make a trip. They can buy comics, videogames and CDs. In other words, they can enjoy their hobbies by earnings which they get through a part-time job. In my opinion, college students have to have a part-time job to develop themselves as a member of society and to know how hard it is to earn the money. ThatÅfs why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
