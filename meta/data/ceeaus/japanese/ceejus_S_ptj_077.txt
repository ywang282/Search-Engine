"I think that working part-time too much is not good for students. 

Firstly, studentsÅf main occupation is more studying or learning expert knowledge.

Working part-time too much interfere with their studying. A friend of mine who entered at KOBE UNIBERSITY with me doesnÅft come to school lately. She hadnÅft been absent from school or late for first morning class before she started to work part-time. She started it last summer holiday and finally she failed many test in the second semester.

She said that her part-time job was very busy and worked until the night, and she canÅft wake up in the next morning. ..What did she enter the university for?

But I also think that working is important for students to learn system, rules and manners of society. Before we start to work for a company, we should learn many necessities for working in society. In case we fall down in our office, we need to practice by working part-time during we are students. And If we work, maybe we can get pleasure of contributing toward society.

So, what is the most important things is to balance work part-time with study in the university. If we work moderately and study hard in the university, if we can achieve to balance the two occupations, surely we, students can spend fuller our time.
