I donft think itfs important for college students to have a part time job. Therefre two reasons why I think so.
 First I think what college students must do is to study and having a part time job is a waste of time. All students must have studied hard when they were high school students to learn a lot of things at colleges. So if they have time to do a part time job, they should study hard instead. Furthermore I have a friend who has many part time jobs and failed. He worked at a restaurants and school for passing college entrance examinations as a teacher at the same time. Those two part time jobs were so hard for him that he wasnft able to study at all. As a result, he couldnft graduate from college. The conclusion is that having a part time job has a risk. 
Second, in my opinion, college students should join some club activities. There they can develop friendships that they can keep forever. Some may say that college students can develop true friendships through part time job, but to cooperate and try toward one goal is peculiar to club activity.
All college students have to do is not have a part time job but study and join club activities. That is why I donft think itfs important for college students to have a part time job.
