I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

Campus lifeÅfs main is not only academic study but also getting ready for life as a member of society.

When they graduate from college, they have to live as a member of society.

Through part-time job, they can learn importance of working, a sense of fulfillment of working, social customs, etiquette, common sense, and so on. Then, human relations spread. Besides, chance that they are exposed to society is increase.

These are very important for college students to live as a member of society.

 

Relatively, college students have a lot of time to spend freely. I think that they should experience various things with that free time. For that reason, they need money. Therefore, it is necessary that college students help for income of part-time job to spend campus life usefully.

 

Of course, it is not good for college students to have a part-time job for all neglecting their studies. However, part-time job is chance to learn about society and learn about our hidden talents and develop mentally. 

 

For that reason, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
