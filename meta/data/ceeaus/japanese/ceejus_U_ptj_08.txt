I agree with the opinion ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part time job.Åh because there are three things we can learn from having a part time job.
The first thing is how to communicate well with any kind of people. We have to be kind to everyone who comes to our store whether we like him/her or not. Anyone who comes to our store is a customer. Sometimes there are some unkind customers, but we can try to coop with them and learn how to get well with them.
The second thing we can also learn from it is how difficult it is to make money. I think most of us donÅft know what it is like to make money by ourselves until we start to do various part time jobs during college days. Then I think we will be able to give thanks to our parents. 
The third thing is the width of society. We will notice that there are various kinds of jobs, and at the same time, unlimited possibilities lie on us. Part time job may give us a chance to think about our future.
I think part time job connects people, like parents and their children, and donÅft forget that it also connects our future and us.
Therefore, I agree with the opinion.
