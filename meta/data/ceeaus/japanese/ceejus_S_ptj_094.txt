"I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to  
have

a part―time job. Indeed, the most important thing for students  
is studying. So students should choice a kind of part―time job  
carefully in order to go college. But having a part―time job has  
a lot of good points. There are some reasons why I think so.

  First, college students have to independent from their parents not  
only financially but also mentally. College students will be able to  
do this goal by having a part―time job.  I think that we should  
earn money which we use for hobby, clothes and so on.

  Second, they will get a chance to have many kinds of associates who  
cannot meet at only university student’s life. There will be  
several persons who have interesting personality or back ground of  
life. They must play an important role in experience of  
student’s life.

  Finally,　college students must learn about a society. After  
they graduate from college, most of them will be a part of member of  
social system. In order to be like it, they work with such person  
before they graduate.

  That is why I think that having a part―time job is important  
for college students.
