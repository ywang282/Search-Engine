Å@I disagree with the statement.
 Some country seems to have a custom of smoking at dinner, same as even
a child. It means that smoking is a good method to be relaxed and enjoy
themselves at dinner time.Å@More over, IÅfve heard from my uncle, who
loves smoking, that smoking is a tool with which people have a nice
dinner and communicate with each other. Indeed we can see people
enjoying having a meal and communicating at restaurant in Japan, say,
izakaya or so. Though it might be because they are drinking, smoking
must help them have a good time.
 Restaurants should offer the place where their customers can enjoy
themselves and have a meal relaxed, even if someone who doesnÅft smoke
insists that the smoke of tobacco does harm than good for him. It is a
restaurant that is responsible for solving the problem like this. In
other words, the restaurant should divide the seats for non-smoker from
those for smoker. And then, both non-smoker and smoker will be satisfied
with the mood of the restaurant and taste dishes good. This experience
would make them come back there again. In order to have their customers
feel like this, restaurants shouldnÅft completely ban smoking.
