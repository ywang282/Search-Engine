 In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
   First, college students can learn our society by working. For example, they learn the way to get money, to communicate with customers and to work with others well. In fact, I had a part-time job and learned so many things, by working. I think these things are useful after I graduate.
   Second, they pay a lot of money to their colleges and most of them is helped by their parents. But they spend a lot of money playing with their friends, buying things they want and traveling with their friends. This is very important so they should do so. But they should get money to play themselves. In fact, I get money for playing myself. I think it is natural and I should do so. 
   Third, college students have a lot of time and energy. Their 150work is very valuable and give energy for society. 
   I think It have many merits for college student to work and they should have a part-time job for their parents and themselves. In consequence, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
