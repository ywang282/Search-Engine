I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job. I have two reasons to think so. 
      The first one is that a part time job helps students to understand about jobs in the society. Many Japanese students are not expected to work. They have only to study in their college. But when students who have not done a part time job graduate from the college and start to work, they get confused because they have never had responsibility for the society. To avoid this situation, students have to work in the society and get a sense of responsibility.
      The second one is that there are students who have to do a part time job because of their economic situation. College students need more money than you expect. They must pay school fee, traffic density and the cost of living if they live alone. If they were banned from doing a part time job some students would give up studying in a college. It is true that students who do a part time job canÅft have all the classes but they study hard to make up for the blank. So it is important to help them.
      Because of the two reasons I agree to students doing a part time job.
