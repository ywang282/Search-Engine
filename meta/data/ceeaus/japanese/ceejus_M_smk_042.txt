I donÅft think smoking is bad. But I am really angry with smoking in the street.
 It is very dangerous. In fact fire of a tobacco took my hand and I got burned. My friend has got burned too. 
 It is more dangerous for children. Because the height of an adult personÅfs hand is the height of a childÅfs head, it is possible for a child to get burned his or her head. 
 It is also a problem that many people throw away their tobacco.
 In particular cities, it is banned to smoking in the street. I agree with it.
