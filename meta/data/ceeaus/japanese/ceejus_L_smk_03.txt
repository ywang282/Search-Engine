In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants inÅ@Japan. There are two reasons for that.

 The first thing is that people who like smoking do not want to go to the restaurant if smoking is completely prohibited. There are a lot of people who like smoking in Japan. Some of them often smoke after the meal. But they have to put up with smoking after it if smoking is controlled. So they can not enjoy eating and drinking at the restaurant. And for people who do not smoke, they can not go to the restaurant with smokers.

 The second thing is that the profit of the restaurant decreases if smoking is forbidden.  If people who like smoking do not go to the restaurant, it is not too much to say that the profit of the restaurant decreases so much. In addition, it is possible that their family or friends do not go to the restaurant as many times as now. In such a case, it will be difficult for the owners of restaurants to keep restaurants.

 Today there are two kinds of seats in many restaurants. One is the seats for smokers; the other is the seats for people who do not smoke. I think that both smokers and people who do not smoke should enjoy at the restaurants. So this service seems good to me.

That is why smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan
