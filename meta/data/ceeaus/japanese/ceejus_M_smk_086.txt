I agree with this statement. Because smoking is the murder as well as the suicide. When one smokes, people around him have greater possibility for cancer and other diseases. Who says it is not the murder? Of course those who do the murder at the restaurants are to be banned. And the penalty for it is very strict. Why smoking is excluded from the murder? In addition to this, smoking is the suicide. The suicide is the murder for oneself. It must be strange to tell the suicide from the murder. These are the same as Åeright Åf war. In the world, right war is impossible because it is nothing but violence. The violence canÅft be right. And smoking canÅft be right, too. That is, the war is direct violence, on the other hand, smoking is ÅeindirectÅfviolence. But according to the custom, these are acceptable. The murder and the suicide at the restaurants could exist. It must be strange. In addition to this, Japan is democratic country. Democracy canÅft go with the violence. And Japan canÅft have any weapons which hurt oneself or others. It is clear that tobacco is a weapon. So we should ban completely smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.
