I agree with this statement. I think all of college students should experience a part-time job, at least once, during their school life, because through it, they can learn how hard to earn money is. 

?Before I experience a part-time job, I got money from my parents. I spent it playing with my friends, eating fast foods, buying clothes etc. But I soon exhausted all money, because the amount of money which I could use per a month was limited by my mother. I irritated about that, and thought that Ågwhy my mother doesnÅft give me more money?Åh 

Then I entered Kobe University and started working as a part-timer (I work at a Japanese bar as a waitress), and knew how hard to earn money is. At workplace, I have to bear many painful duties. For example, I must keep smiling, must run, must take heavy dishes, must be kind to every customer, and sometime IÅfm scolded by my master. These make me very tired, but after enduring them, I can get money. In this way I really knew the value of money. We should not spend money without knowing how thankful thing money is.

ThatÅfs why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
