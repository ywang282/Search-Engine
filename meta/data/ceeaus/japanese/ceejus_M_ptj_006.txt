 I agree with the statement. I think that it is too early for high school students to do, but that it is just good time for college students to do. I have some reasons I think so.
 First, they need to earn money to play and to date alone. I think some of them are given money by their parents, but we must be independent from their parents soon. When we graduate from university, we must work, earn, and make on living. So, it is learning that we have a part-time job. 
 Second, to have a part-time job is an opportunity to know many persons. Actually, I make some friends through a part-time job. Some goes to Kobe University, other goes to different university. If I donÅft have the part-time job, I never encounter them. It is very fun to know with persons who go to different university. And it is very fun to know with person who is different years. Especially, I think I learn many things, when I talk with adults. 
 Each person has different thought, so it is important to know many persons and to talk with them. Such an opportunity is just to have a part-time job. Therefore, I think college students should have different part-time job so that we experience.
