 I agree this opinion. I have a strong opinion for smoking. Generally
speaking smoking causes many problems to our body and to our daily lives.
People lose their healthy body for long years smoking habit. Sometime lose
their lives. And what is worse, it lose health not only people who smoke by
themselves but also who stay with smoking people. It is too dangerous for
us.
     And many smokers throw cigarettes at the street. There are lots of
cigarettes on the street in the city. I hate smoking people. Especially I
hate people who smoke during eating. It is the worst one. 
     I sometime go to eat restaurant with my family. At the restaurant we
enjoy the atmosphere and conversation and off course the taste of each
dishes. About over 10 years ago, there were few restaurants which banned
smoking. Many people smoked at the restaurant in spite of eating. All
members of my family did not like smoking. So suddenly the smoke was coming
our table, we felt very bad. And after that we felt tastes of the dishes
were not good. 
     Please imagine particles of the smoke attaching on the raw fish at
sushi restaurant! The fresh fish changes bad one at the moment.
     Recently people learn the harm of smoking and have consciousness of
smoking. For our happiness smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants in Japan forever.
