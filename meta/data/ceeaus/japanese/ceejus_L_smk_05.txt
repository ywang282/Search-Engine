 I disagree with this opinion because I think it is the best of people to stay without constraint.
Surely, nonsmokers are likely to hate smoke because it smells bad and hurt not only smokersÅfs body but also theirs. IÅfm one of them. So, I always want waiters to make smokers set away from me.
 If all the restaurant ban smoking, nonsmokers are happy to be released from smoke and may be able to eat calmly.
While, if this situation was realized, smokers would get angry. Or, someone may do nothing but eat without going restaurant.
And, it is no exaggeration to say that smoking is the most important thing for them. If they were robbed the cigarette, they would be unsettled state of mind or be much stressed.
Then, I think that it is the best way for people to establish both smoking area and nonsmoking area at the same restaurant. As smoke doesnÅft pour into nonsmoking area, an equipment such as big air cleaner must be placed. So, both smokers and nonsmokers get to stay without constraint and be pleased to go there. The restaurant also can earn much more.
Thus, restaurant must make customers as much as possible be satisfied with service and kindness. I assert that as one of the service, to establish both smoking area and nonsmoking area is welcome to everyone.
