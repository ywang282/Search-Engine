"I agree with this statement. I have three reasons for this. 
One of the reasons is that we can make a lot of friends in part-time job. For example, we can see another college students, housewives or free-lances. They bring us new and peasant experiences. They tell us interesting stories that we never have listened. People who we meet in part-time job will benefit us when we start working in the future.
 The second reason is that we can know the importance of money and the difficulty of working. Part-time job of college students are often teaching for high school students or staffs of restaurants. We work only after school. So we cannot earn many money. Until I enter college, I had gotten allowance from my parents. Now I start part-time job and appreciate their kindness.
 The third reason is that we can develop our own abilities: we can master politeness if we engage in service occupation or we can become wiser if we give lectures. We can develop abilities which we canÅft study in college. These abilities will help us in another occasion.
 For these reasons, I conclude that college student should have various part-time jobs and have a lot of experiences.    "
