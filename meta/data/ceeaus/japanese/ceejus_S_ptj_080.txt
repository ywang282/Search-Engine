"I think that part-time job is important for college students, and for
the following reason.
First, by working with many other people, we can acquaint ourselves with
them.
Making many friends is very important in our lives.
Second, we experience new environment that we have not known,Å@so we can
learn many important things. For example a social rules such as a
greeting, responsibility, and attitude. They are essential for college
students to go out into the public society.
But it is very difficult to learn social rules. We may mistake many time
at part-time job.
We may be got angry. Through these bitter experiences, we surely become
adult. So I think we need some mistakes at the part-time job. In public
society, it is too late for us to make a mistake. Part-time job is first
step to go into the society.
Third, we can earn money on our own. I think most of college students
work because of this third reason not first or second reason. College
students have much free time. Using their time for them is efficient.
For these reasons, I think part-time job is necessary, so I agree with
that college students do part-time job.
