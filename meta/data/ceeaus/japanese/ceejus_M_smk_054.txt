I think that smoking shouldnÅft be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Someone may disagree to me because smoking is bad not only for the smoker but also for other people. But, if all owners of restaurants in Japan banned to smoke, smokers would feel very sad. Indeed, I also hate the smell of smoke, yet we cannot ignore the right of smokers.
 I sometimes go to restaurant with my friends or family. Then, we are often asked  by the staff whether there is smoker in us. This means that the restaurant has smoking area and non-smoking area. It is good system because two rights are thought about. What two rights mean are the right of smoking and the one to get clean air. 
 Recently, smoking is banned at too many places. For example, itÅfs banned in parks, on streets or even at restaurants. Probably, smokers want to go to restaurant. But itÅfs hard for them to stop smoking. So, restaurants should have two areas, which is smoking area and non-smoking area.
 Good society is the one that all the people (of course include smokers) can live comfortably. So, smoking should be allowed at some areas in restaurants.
