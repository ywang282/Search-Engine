  People who smoke frequently say that smoking is ÅgoishiiÅh. ÅgOishiiÅh generally means delicious in Japanese. However, in this case, what it really means is not delicious but Ågfeeling relaxedÅh. This idea may be beyond comprehension for people who donÅft smoke, but at least it appears that some people feel at home by smoking.
   At restaurants, people often eat, drink, have a conversation with their friends or family, and so on. That is to say, it is not too much to say that at restaurants each person spends his time feeling relaxed in some form or other. Then, thinking smoking plays an important role in the comfort of people, it can be said that itÅfs all right to smoke at restaurants.
   Nowadays, a lot of people have thought that smoking does you no good and much harm, so they would like cigarettes to be completely done away with. However, it seems that this idea is only from the side of health. Smoking is not entirely good for health, to be sure, but whether smoking is good for health or not isnÅft important here because this is a personal problem. If people in good health complain the cigarette smoke does harm, they will make seats in the smoking section, and have already wrestled with this problem at almost all the restaurants in Japan. Therefore, smoking doesnÅft have to be ÅgcompletelyÅh banned at all the restaurants.
