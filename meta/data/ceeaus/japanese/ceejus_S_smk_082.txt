I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan for the following reasons.  The restaurants are the place where people not only eat the food but also enjoy talking and feel relax.  People who smoke usually wants to smoke every one or two hours.  Also there are people who are looking for a smoke after eating.  Smoking is banned at a lot of places in Japan now, for instance at an office, at a street, in a taxi and so on.  If smoking is completely banned even at all the restaurants, they will get irritated.  In addition, I have watched the news on TV that the staff at restaurants complained, which is in a town forbidden completely to smoke at all the public places.  They said that they had less customers than before smoking is forbidden.  Therefore banning from smoking is not good for the restaurants as well as smokers.  I think that it is enough as long as the restaurants make a smoking section and a non-smoking section.  They don't have to ban smoking.  That is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
