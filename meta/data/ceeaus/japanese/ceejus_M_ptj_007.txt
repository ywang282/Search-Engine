I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for four reasons.
 First, you can experience everything we need for the future through working. It is sometimes too hard for you to continue. But knowledge and experiences you get through working will be helpful when you go into the society.  
Second, you can get money. It is essential for your life. Nobody can do without it. When you get it after hard working, you will know the importance of money through getting it by yourself. Perhaps you may come to stop wasting money.
Third, you can be conscious of being no longer a child. And you can feel how graceful your parents are. If you have never thought your parentÅfs troubles, it will be a chance to think of them. 
Finally, you can come to know many people. Some of them much elder and others are younger than you. You can work with them and make friends with them. The friends may advise you how to live and what to do when you are in trouble.  Anyway, you can broaden your sight and learn to think deeply more than when you have only friends usually around yourself.
Of course you must study as a college student. And even if you are still a college student, you must work seriously as long as you decide to do the job. But mistakes will strengthen you by getting through it many times. You can practice working before you go into the society. So I think it important to do a part-time job.
