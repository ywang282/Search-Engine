I disagree this opinion. There are two reasons. First, although this
opinion may be for people who donÅft smoke, most restaurants separate
seats for smoking from seats which we must not smoke, so both people who
smoke and donÅft smoke can be pleasant now. Second, heavy smokers are
able not to go to the restaurants. If the restaurants become to be so,
we are able not to go to them together heavy smokers and they will be
very angry. I think that we should give them consideration. But, I donÅft
speak Åg Smoking is goodÅh I think that it is so bad. There are four
reasons. First, it causes smokers to be sick., for example, lung cancer.
Second, people around them are also damaged. Third, the environment is
worsen because of cutting down many trees to get paper for cigarettes.
Fourth, I donÅft like smell of smoke of cigarettes. In short, smokers
should smoke on the place on which there are a little people and smoke a
few cigarettes in order not to be nuisance to other people, that is to
say, all the restaurants in Japan should not ban smoking completely but
separate seats for smoking from seats which we must not smoke.
