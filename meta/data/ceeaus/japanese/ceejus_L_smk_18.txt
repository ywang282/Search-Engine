I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons why I think so.
First, I think cigarettes can make oneÅfs identity and tell me felling of smoker. I have some friends and acquaintances who I characterize smoker. They who are not smoking are not real them for me and I like them who are smoking better than them who are not smoking. Furthermore, I guess feeling of smokers by their pace of smoking and how to smoke. So cigarettes are important for me when I talk with smokers. I want to enjoy spending with real them in restaurant and talk with real them. I think restaurant is not only place to eating but also place to have a good time.
Second, I think cigarettes can make atmosphere. It is dangerous, mysterious and adult atmosphere. I think that some restaurants contain this atmosphere and attraction of these restaurants is composed of this atmosphere. Probably customers of these restaurants enjoy this atmosphere. If smoking is banned completely at these restaurants, the number of customers will reduce. I think we should remain these restaurants, but if smoking is banned completely at these restaurants, these restaurants will vanish. 
By these reasons, I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
