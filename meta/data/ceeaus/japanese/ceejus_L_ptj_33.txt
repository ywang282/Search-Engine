"I think it is very good that college student have part time job.
Off course, I also do part time job.
Good point of part time job is, first, it can be meaningful use of our
free time.
Before I began a part time job, I didnÅft know how to deal with my after
school time.
Second, it teaches us how important money is.
When I was high school student, I was gave pocket money from parents.
I didnÅft know how hard earning money is before began it.
