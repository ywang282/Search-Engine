Today,a lot of developed countrys have started to ban customer from smoking at 

Restaurants.The countrysf governments have ensured their citzensf right to be free from 

otherfs smok.So why they could do it? One of the reasons is that nonsmokerfs insistence-we have the right to be free from otherfs smoke-is so strong.They have said gIt is wrong that we,nonsmokers,havedamaged from passive smoking.But in japan,there are more smokers than that of other developed countrys.So first,the governments or city administrations should enforce the low of prohibitting smoking at all restaurants to save nonsmokers from passive smoke.

    These days,I often have heard that more and more minor have started to smoke in Japan.That is one of social problems.Some of these children have seen a lot of smoking thing.Say in other words,smoking is so natural thing for them in their life.But in Japan,minorsfsmoking is not allowed.To reduce childrenfs smoking,to begin with saving them from the surroundings that lots of adults have smoked.If the low of prohibitting smoking at all restaurants is ensured,many children are free from the surroundings at least in restaurant.a lot of children often use restaurants.So that is very effective to save them.
