In my case, I have to work part-time. I mainly work at a supermarket, and also work as a tutorial and cram school teacher. 
Why do I work so much? This is because IÅfm a so-called working student. If I didnÅft work, I couldnÅft go to university, buy something I want, and even eat lunch. Therefore, for me, working is important.
However, for rich people, part-time job is not important. Part-time job means that we exchange our precious time for cheap pay. Some people say that it is important for us to work part-time when we are students, for social study. You might have been taught like that.
Do you really think that if we worked part-time job, we could know one of the most important thing of our life? I want to insist that such a thing is a lie.
I think we should spend times significantly. For example, to participate in the volunteer, enjoy club activities, or study what we really want. These activities really make us experience good thing. There are a lot of thing that can be done when we are only student. Unlike those activities, we can work at any times in our long life. In other words, when we become independent, we have to work all our life.
So, I am opposite to working part-time when we are student.
