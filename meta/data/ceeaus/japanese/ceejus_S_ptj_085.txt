"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.

First, college students need a lot of money. For example, I think we 
ourselves, not our parents, ought to pay our tuition fee of the college. 
Furthermore, if you want to join a club, you have to pay an entrance fee. If 
you want to go shopping with your friends, money is necessary.

Second, it is true that college students are very busy studying, but in my 
opinion, we can cope with both studying and part-time jobs. These days, 
there are some part-time jobs which we can take a day off from during the 
test terms.

Third, to have a part-time job helps you to find what you want to do in the 
future. There are a large number of college students who cannot decide their 
future plans in detail. Therefore, if you have a part-time job which you are 
interested in, you are able to choose the most suitable job for you after 
graduating from the college.

For these reasons, in order to get significant campus life, it is important 
for college students to have a part-time job. I donÅft have a part-time job 
now, but I am going to have a part-time job during the summer vacation.
