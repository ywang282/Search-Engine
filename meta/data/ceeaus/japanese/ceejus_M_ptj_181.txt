"I agree with this subject. Many students work part-time in order to enjoy school life. Enjoyment differs from student to student. That is playing with friends or getting to a license or saving or paying for oneÅfs hobby. But some student can not get credit because they work part-time. They lose sight of original purpose. Some parent opposes this subject because of this. Money that student earn in school life is little. When students become a member of society, they earn same money soon. So they should pay money that they earn soon. Money to pay in school life is difficult from money to pay in society life. 

I know student who pay school fee. KOBE University is public university, but this school fee is never cheap. This price is seven hundred thousand by year. For students, this price is very high price. So he always works part-time. When I think him, I think     students who can spend school life without working is rich. Some students need not work, but some students need work. Some students are rich, some students are poverty. 

Because in university students have various circumstances, I think students work part-time without losing credit should be permitted
