"I also think that it is important for college students to have a
part-time job. I have two reasons. First, college students need much
money for parties or ÅgnomikaiÅh. Of course, college students have not to
join these. But if they join ÅgnomikaiÅh, they will get something by
talking with older college students. Then it will make their college
life more meaningful and help them make more friends. In other word,
college students need much money for making much more circumstance
around them.
 Second, some college students live alone. They have to get money for
eating or living. Of course, their parents may give them some money. But
it usually runs short. So, it is important for them to have a part-time
job. Also, some people go to college from far place. They need money for
expensive fare or buying bike. If college studentsÅf having a part-time
job were banned, they would not go to college. In brief, they have a
part-time job for surviving or going to college.
 It is true that college students should study. But I think that college
life is not only studying but also experiencing various things to live
at society. That is why it is important for college students to have a
part-time job."
