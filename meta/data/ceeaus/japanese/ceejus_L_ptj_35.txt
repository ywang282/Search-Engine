"I agree to students having part time jobs. 

Because students can learn many things by having part time jobs

Firstly, students can learn real society by part time jobs  

It will never be studied at school.

By learning it  students gradually become adults.

Secondly, a part time job can be improved studentÅfs communication skill.

In the place there are many persons who are different from age and character.

To work with various persons is certainly improved studentÅfs communication skill 

Thirdly by a part time job students can learn importance for money 

Until now we get money for our parents. 

So to get money by yourselves is improved your sense of value for money

But a part time job is not only good.

For example , some students may work part time jobs too much to have times to study.

Some students may work part time jobs too much. They donÅft have times to sleep. 

They may sleep in the lessons and donÅft  follow the lessons.

Not to do it we have to get along with college lifes and part time jobs.

It is important for students to study in the college and work part time jobs

And I think students enjoy college life.
