I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job. Most of students require money for playing, club activity, shopping, eating, and so on. I think we should earn the money we use ourselves because we soon or already twenty years old. We rely on our parents for a long time, we should independent. I think, to earn myself is a first step to independent. After graduate collage, we start to live as a member of society. To have a part-time job and earn money is training of it.
Studying at collage is most important for our students, but we canÅft learn all things at collage. Part-time job is a place of social study, I think. We can learn social environment, economy and person relationship through part-time job. And we can experience many things in society. Also, we can work our favorite job. These experiences can be useful when we find employment in the future. Moreover, through part-time job, we can meet many people. So we can get many friends and extend our world.
Collage students have a lot of time. So we should spend this time significant. Through part-time job, we can get money and good experience. To have and work a part-time job is very good way, I think.
