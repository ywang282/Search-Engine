Some people enjoy smoking, though they know that some bad substances
which are contained in cigarette, for instance nicotine, tar and so on,
affect their health. They, especially heavy smokers, may be irritated if
they canft take a smoke, while taking meals or after.
If smoking is forbidden at all restaurants, I think only nonsmokers and
light smokers enjoy meals. But I want the heavy to have a good time too
not only at lunch time but also at morning or at dinner.
But other people hate completely cigarettefs smell or smoke. Thatfs
smoke affects those around the smoker as a passive smoker.
As the means of an elimination of passive smoking, there is banning on
smoking at restaurants, separating of the seats, or having equipments
for filtering bad substances from the air.
So it is no wonder that smokersf area is separated from nonsmokersf at
restaurants these days. This is one simple means of keeping nonsmokers
from affects of passive smoking.
All restaurants should have also some machines that can change the foul
air to the fresh air, for example an air cleaner. If so, at the same
place nonsmokers and smokers can eat together.
I donft think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in
Japan, if there are some rules or equipments for smoking like these.
