I agree with the idea. There are two reasons why I think so. 
Firstly, I think college students should earn money and support their familyfs finance. 
Generally speaking, college students need much money for tuition fee, text books, clothes, and so on. And many college students have enough time to have a part time job. So they can work if they want to. Itfs possible to rely on their parents for money, but I think college students are old enough to work and help their family. Even if the money they can get from a part time job is little, itfs important to try to make money by themselves.
 Secondly, a part time job will be very precious experience for college students. In fact, Ifve taken a part time job at restaurant and I learn many things from it. For example, I learned how to behave politely and the importance of smile thorough my job. To make customers feel relaxed, itfs important to behave politely. Not only politeness, but also smile is very important. I think that learning many things like this will improve me. Itfs good to know what it is like to gworkh through a part time job before we graduate and start to work at company. 
So for these reason, I think itfs important for college students to have a part time job.
