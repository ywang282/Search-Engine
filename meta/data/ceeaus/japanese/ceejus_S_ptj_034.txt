I think it important college students do a part time job. In　fact, I do a part time job．
The first reason I do a part time job is to earn money．When I enter the Kobe　university, I left my home. I live alone now. That needs much money. I think that　trouble my parents. And, I have a younger sister. So, I have to earn money as I can. 
The second reason is being able to get to know new person in the place of a part time job. In fact, I make new other university friends in my work place. Seniors and regular members are very sensible people. I work in very good environment. Taking people is a good thing for me living alone.
The third reason is doing a part time job is a good experience for me. A service trade is　very hard. I studied an honorific and how to correspond. I think it good doing these works until enter the society.
It is very hard to manage both of study and a part rime job successfully. But, it is not to become independent until a man can manage both of study and a part time job. A part time job is important in the point to train one’s mind.
That is why I think it important to do a part time job.
