I agree that college students have a part-time job. I have two reasons for that.
 First, they can earn much money. I think college students are required to pay much money than ever for something, for example, drinking with their friends, getting a car license, traveling this country or foreign countries, and so on. They should get money by myself, not by their parents. 
 Second, they can learn polite Japanese expression. Recently, it is said that many young people cannot use polite expression. It is not good for them when they work in the future. So, while they are students, they should experience to use polite expression.
 I insisted good points to have a part-time job, but there is one point that they have to be careful. That is a balance between a part-time job and studying. I think most important thing for college student is studying. Therefore, I recommend having a part-time job unless it prevents them from studying.
