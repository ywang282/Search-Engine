   I agree that smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurants in Japan. ItÅfs because smoking donÅft feel good to some people including me. 
   I went to a restaurant with a friend who often smokes. When we had a dinner, he smoked and his smoke blew in my face, so I felt bad. Tastes of the dishes became bad. If all smokers were to be able to care about place and others, we donÅft need to make rules. 
   I canÅft understand that why young people become smokers although it is clear medically that smoking is very bad for healthy. Moreover passive smoking is also bad for us. In Norway and in some states of America, Australia and other countries, all the restaurants ban smoking. ItÅfs because passive smoking wreck employees there. So making legislation to ban smoking in the restaurants and hotel is important for non-smokers and also for smokers because it might make them keep from smoking. Young people who become smokers might decrease. Compared with the West, Japan falls behind for campaign against smoking. So I feel happy that the mood of no-smoking spreads in the society and that people around me are more temperate in their smoking. 
   Therefore, we need to have a legislation to ban smoking.
