"I agree this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.There are three reasons.

 Firstly,it is because that it is good chance for college students to take part in job until they graduates from college and have a full-time job. This experience is useful to find their full-time job. In addition,they really understand that it is difficult and important to get money. They thank their parents and begin to spend money more carefully. Some people say that college students should study and join a club activity. However,college students can get important things from not only studies but also a part-time job.

 Secondly,it is because that college students can earn their tuition if they work as a part-timer. They are able to help their parents because tuition of college is high. In addition, college students can save money for some goals. In fact, a friend of mine works as a part-timer and save money in order to study abroad after she graduates from college. I canÅft think that she wastes time and her energy.

 Finaly, college students can meet and communicate with a lot of people. Talking with many people is quite meaningful for college students. They can get very important   things from it. Also, it will be useful for them in the future.

 For these three reasons, I think that college students should have a part-time job.
