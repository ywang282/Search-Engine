Many restaurants separated smoking area from not smoking area in Japan.
But The separation of smoking area is not done completely
.Therefore,even if we have lunch or dinner in not smoking area in a
restaurant, we sometimes  feel unpleasantness for smoking. But it is not
good to prohibit smoking perfectly.  Perfect prohibition of smoking will
cause decreasing of profit  from selling cigarette .
The rate of smoking person in Japan is big compared to some other
advanced country. And young smoking people increase these days. So, if
smoking is banned , people who come to the restaurant and sales of
cigarette will decrease. This decreasing is severe for many restaurants
and Japan. Because, cigarette is one of important source of tax.
Of course, separation of smoking area must be done more surely and
smoking people may be needed for good smoking manner. Because a thought
that passive smoking is bad for health of people  who are surrounding
smoker is spreaded all over Japan.
However , many people believe this thought whether it is correct or not,
they don't think that smoking must be prohibited unless they are in
danger ob passive smoking.
As far as the separation of smoking area is completely done ,I think
that smoking need not to be banned.
