"Å@I think college student should have a part-time job, because they have
a lot of free time and college is a place where students find what they
really want to do in their future. So, to use time effectively, they
should try many things, whether they are interested in or not, and
experience a lot. To experience many situations and to communicate with
various kinds of people make their way of thinking about life more
profound. If college students had a part-time job, they would get not
only manners, tolerance, but also a chance to take part in society as a
supplier. They have to realize how difficult to earn money. In my
opinion, no one can get it, while they depend on their parents. Almost
all college students are grown-up, so I think they should prepare money
for living by themselves.

College students also have stamina, so it is very good for them to use
it for learning about a lot of things, enjoying with their friends
something which they can do at the time, and working hard in a part-time
job. To do these things earnestly, these become their source of life.
That is why we should do anything our best.
