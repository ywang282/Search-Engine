I think it is important for college student to do a part time jobs.There are some reasons that make me think so.First,in campus life ,it is important for college student not only to stdy but also to play with friends.To play with friends ,we need money .So we have to do a part time job to make money.In campus life ,it is indispensable for colllege student to enjoy themselves.Second,we can study society.For example,in a part time job of service,we have to pay attention to custemer constantly.Thanks to this,we can come to give a lot of care for friends.Besides ,for example,we notice greeting is important.When we worked in an ofice,greeding is essentinal.Third,we find it difficult to get money.Before we do a part time job, we have thought that money is a thing parents gve us easily and soon.But after we did a part time job,we notice.Parents worked hard and get money.Parents give us this important money.Because I knew importance of moneyand difficulty of getting money.I thanked
 parents again.Because of these reasons I think it is important for collepe student to do a part time job.After you did a part time job you feel something important.
