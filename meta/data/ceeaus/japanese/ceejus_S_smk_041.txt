I agree with this statement. One of the reasons is that many people tend
to feel uncomfortable when they eat dinner with smokers.
In fact, some of restaurants in Japan make areas that people can smoke,
but that is not useful. For example, when my mother and I went to such
restaurant, we wanted to eat dinner in the nonsmoking area but we canft
because that area was filled. We ate in the smoking area, but we felt so
bad that we couldnft eat dinner very much. Finally, we went out the
restaurant.
The other day we went to another restaurant, we could eat dinner in the
nonsmoking area, but because of smoke from the smoking area we canft
also enjoy dinner.
Another reason is that smoking in the places where many people use such
as the restaurant is very dangerous.
Sometimes only a cigarette could cause a big fire. Everyday many people
eat dinner in the restaurant. Not only adults but also children come
into the restaurant. If cigarette that man is smoking touch children,
children will burn themselves.
Moreover, smoking is bad for not only smokerfs health but also the
health of other people around the smoker. If we eat dinner with smokers,
in spite of nonsmokers we may suffer from a serious disease that is
caused by smoking. So, smoking should be completely banned at all the
restaurants in Japan.
