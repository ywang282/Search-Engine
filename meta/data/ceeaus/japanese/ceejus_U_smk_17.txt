I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons to support this idea; passive smoking, smell of smoke, and inefficiency of separating.

	The chemicals which were included in smoke of cigarettes will do harm to people. The harm for passive smokers is sometimes worse than that for active smokers.  Therefore, being passive smokers is very dangerous for people in restaurants particularly for children and pregnant women. In restaurants, thereÅfre many kinds of people, such as men, women, baby, children, elderly, pregnant womenÅcand so on. For that reason, I think itÅfs not wise decision to allow smoking in restaurants.

	For second reason, I think that the smell of smoke will spoil the delightful time of meal. When we eat something, we enjoy not only its taste but also its smell. In fact, the smell of food affects the taste very much. When I went to Kyoto, I entered a Japanese cafe, and I was enjoying gentle delicious smell of green tea which I ordered. At the moment, strong smell of smoking attacked my nose; it spoiled my pleasure at once.

Some people say that if we separate people by making smoking section and non-smoking section, there will be no problem. However, I think that it is not inefficient way for restaurants. If thereÅfre too many people who prefer non-smoking section, they have to wait for the seats even though thereÅfre empty seats in smoking section. In addition, the owners of restaurants have to make a wall between two sections to prevent from smoke flowing into non-smoking section. I think it cost much.

From these reasons, I think that all smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
