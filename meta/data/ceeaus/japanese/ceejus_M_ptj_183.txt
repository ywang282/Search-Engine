I agree to this opinion. Because having a part-time job teaches college students important things. First, we can know worth of money. In fact, I think that it is difficult to get money by having a part-time job. When I was a high school student, I spent money given by my parents. But then, I didnÅft know worth of money, because I didnÅft have a part-time job!

  Second, we can know social manners. In my case, I became polite, because my part-time job is service job in a restaurant. But, I canÅft learn many social manners in college. So, having service jobs teach us how to contact with other people. I think that this experience will be useful for me after I graduate this college.

  Third, we can get skills. In my case, I can get cooking skills. These skills are very useful for me living alone. We will be able to get various skills by experiencing many part-time jobs. 

  By these reasons, I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. But we have not to forget that we are college students, and we have to attend classes in college and study hard.
