 Smoking is very bad for health. In America and many other countries, many people are getting sick or have died for smoking diseases. It is because nicotine, which is included in a cigarette, causes lung cancer. When people smoke, they get nicotine with their breath and it collects at their lung. After many years go through, nicotine which costed for many years causes lung cancer. Thus, smoking is very bad for health. In addition to it, smoking is very dangerous not only for smoking people but also for non smoking people. If people smoke, smokes which contain nicotine are produced and are widespread in the air. And by breathing it, people around the smoker get nicotine. Some people say that since the smoke which is widespread in the air contains more nicotine than the nicotine smoker directly gets, people around the smokers may have higher risks to get a lung cancer than smokers themselves have. So smoking is very dangerous not only for smokers but also for non smokers and this is why I disagree with this statement. Because people have a right to smoke and not a few people want to smoke even if there are risks like a lung cancer, I donÅft forbid smoking. However, non smokers also have a right to lead a healthy life. So people may smoke at the private place, but they shouldnÅft be allowed to smoke at the public place.
