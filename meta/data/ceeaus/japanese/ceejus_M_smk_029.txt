 I donÅft agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at all. This is not because I am a smoker. In fact, I donÅft smoke at all and hate smoking. Then, there are some reasons why I think so.
  These days, it is very often said that smoking is not good for our health and smoking tend to get a cancer. However, many people smoke in spite of the advice. In addition, there is an opinion that when nonsmokers breathe the smoke of cigarette, nonsmokers tend to get a cancer more than smoker tend to do.
  Only because of these reasons, it is too one-sided to adapt smoker to nonsmoker. In restaurants, if they ban smoking in all areas, people who want to smoke canÅft smoke and if they put up with smoking, they canÅft enjoy themselves and maybe they feel bad. 
  I think that it is good to make the partition wall or the partition room that separate smokers from nonsmokers. When we do it, it isnÅft one-sided and it is a fair solution, I think. In restaurants these days, some make such things and shop assistants ask us whether we smoke or not or which seats we sit down. So, it is nice to be complete. 
  Therefore, there is no necessity to be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
