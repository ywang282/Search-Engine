"I agree with it. There are three reasons.
First, we can have good social experience before we join society.
Second, we can get money for studying, living and enjoying a college life.
Third, we canÅft have such an experience only when we are college students.

For example, I work for a bakery now.
I can study right talking, in Japanese we call it keigo.
If I didnÅft work for this shop, I would not be able to talk it.
Then, I live oneself.
So, I buy many things, food, clothes and books etc by money which I get
from part-time job.
I practice living oneself  in the future.
By working there, I can meet many people, and I can spend good time with
them.
And, I can know many things which I donÅft know.
For example, bakery wokers call packing bread ÅgsoccerÅh.

I have worked for juku.
I taught junior high school students English.
They studied very hard.
When I saw them, I wanted to teach them many things, and I studied very
hard too.
When I leave there, because I would be moving, I was very sad because I
missed them.
This is my good memory.

In this way, I have good experience by part-time job.
So, I think it is important for college students to have it."
