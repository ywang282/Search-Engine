I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all
the restaurants in Japan. I want the government to make such a rule, because
cigarette smoke makes us unpleasant.
 First, smoke of a cigarette is a bad smell. No matter when I smell a
cigarette smoke, I feel bad. If somebody else smoke near me when I eat the
meal, I feel terrible. I hate it very much. I think that not only I but
there must be many people who hate a smell of a cigarette smoke.
 Second, the reason why we go to restaurant is to eat delicious food.
However, if we are smoked a cigarette smoke from somebody else and our meal
tastes bad, we feel terrible. If we feel the taste of our meal is bad, not
only non-smoker but also cook feels bad. I think cooks make their dishes as
hard as they can and they must want us to enjoy their meal. I donÅft think
smokers have a right to prevent us from enjoying the meal.
 Third, the smoke and the bad smell can drift everywhere in restaurant. We
canÅft keep out them. Therefore I think all we can do to keep out the smoke
and the bad smell is only to ban smoking completely at restaurant.
 These are the reason why I agree with the opinion that smoking should be
completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
