Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I donft smoke. I donft like smoking. I hope I can deliciously eat every day. So, I donft want to go to the restaurants where some people smoke. 

I have a horrible experience before. I went to the restaurant to have a lunch with my family. When I was eating my favorite dish hamburger steak, a man by our table got smoking. As the smoke came to me, I hated eating it. Because the taste of the hamburger stake mixed with smoke, I would like him to have stopped smoking.

Smoke is some bad effects on our taste and smell. And it is a great damage for nonsmoking people to breathe smoke.

Now in Japan, many restaurants and cafes have both smoking area and nonsmoking area. But there are a few restaurants and cafes that they have both smoking room and nonsmoking room. So smoking should be completely banned.

Japanese food is loved in the world. Many foreigners come to Japan every year. They have many meals at the restaurants in Japan. Japanese food is especially a delicate food. I hope they can deliciously eat Japanese food at the restaurants in Japan.
