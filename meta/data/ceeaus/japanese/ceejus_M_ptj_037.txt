I think it is important to have a part time job. Because most of college students need much money to live and enjoy their life.
There are two reasons to think so.
First, I think it is difficult for many people to eat what they want to eat, buy what they want without part-time job and do what they want to do. I think college students have to do all things they are interested in. To do everything without afraid will make their life interesting. It is very important. And if we do not part-time job, we do nothing and make no memories. I think it is sad.
Second, doing part-time job is good experience to know society. To do part-time job means to get money. It is not easy thing. At school, if there are some problems, for example not to do job to do in class or not to do homework, your teacher or friends help you. But, if you do part-time job, there are difficult problem to solve, only depending on other people is not admitted. We need to think and solve ourself. It is needful skill for everyone. So doing part-time job is important experience to get this skill.
I am doing part-time job. Sometime there are hard jobs, but I enjoy it. So I think it is important to have a part time job.
