Å@I agree with this opinion because of some reasons.

Å@First, it is bad for many peopleÅfs health to smoke at restaurants. Recent studies show that smoke which near-smokers people snuff has more poisonous chemicals than smoke which is inhaled by smokers. Not only persons who sit at table with a smoker but also another customers will suffer passive smoking, even if one smokes at the restaurants.

Å@Second, if restaurantÅfs owners allow smoking, they will suffer a loss. Do you want to eat with smoking people? Of course, you will say ÅgNoÅh, because tobacco fumes spoil delicious foods. If tobacco fumes make some guests unpleasant at a restaurants, they wonÅft want to visit there again. And, if restaurants have smoking space, they must also have devices to air and to prevent from firing. But these systems cause restaurantÅfs owners economic burdens. In other words, it is not profitable for them to exist smokers at restaurants.

Å@Finally, paradoxically, it is smokers who get advantage to be excluded from restaurants. If the places where they can smoke decrease, they have to bother to find smoking space when they want to smoke. People who feel it troublesome may begin to stop smoking. Moreover, it will be one of the good prompt for persons who want to break them habit of smoking but canÅft to exclude smokers from restaurants.

Å@Because of above three reasons, we can know that prohibiting smoking at restaurants is good for smokers, other customers and restaurantÅfs owners. So, I think that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan
