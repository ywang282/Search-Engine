 I think college students should have a part-time job if they have enough time. There are two reasons for thinking of it. 
Firstly, it is necessary for college students to experience what it is like about working. And a part-time job is one of the most suitable ways to experience it. Now I work at juku, Japanese cram school, and teach two students some subjects at the same time. I havenÅft realized the difficulty in teaching someone before I started to work although I wanted to get an English teacherÅfs license. At first, I thought it hard to work there but now IÅfm really happy when my students understand what I teach them. WhatÅfs more, I came to have responsibility for working because IÅfm employed and I have to get students to improve grades. 
Secondly, you can meet many people, especially people who are members of society. I also meet many kinds of people at my working place. In particular, senpai, who work there much longer than me, often help me and advice me what to do in some situation. Their attitudes toward working are always helpful for me. 
To be sure, some people may say it is important for college students to study than to have a part-time job or they should experience job training instead of a part-time job. However, I think a part-time job is kind of study and a term of job training is very short. 
ThatÅfs why I suggest that college students have a part-time job.
