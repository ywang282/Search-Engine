
Cigarette contains various kinds of chemical material, for instance, nicotine, tar, and so on and those smoke also contain harmful material.

So cigarette smoke can make non smoker sick, for example, lung cancer.

Therefore non smoker have a right not to breathe cigarette smoke. Smokers give great risk to non smokers unconsciously. So restaurants have a great responsibility to defend non smokers.

We enjoy not only taste but also smell of dishes at restaurants.

If we smell tobacco when we eat dishes, we do not enjoy the dish and feel that dishes of this restaurant are not so delicious even if those dishes are very delicious. We probably have bad rumor that dishes of that restaurants are not so good or that restaurants do not prepare good condition for eating. Even if restaurants install seats of non smokers, non smokers cannot avoid tobacco smoke completely because we cannot see chemical materials which are released by smoking.

In order not to get bad rumor and in order to benefit, it is the easiest way for restaurants to ban smoking.  

In the end, from these reasons, ashtrays should be eliminated from all restaurants in Japan.
