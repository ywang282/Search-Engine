"I think that it is great for college students to work part-time. First of all, in my case, I live by myself. So my mother supports money to live. But when I go shopping and go out somewhere with my friends, I shouldnÅft use money which my mother gave me. I think that it is bad to be supported too much money and to depend on our parents very much.  So, it is good for us to work part-time to be independent of our parents.
Next, we can learn the importance to earn money and the hardship to work by working part-time. If we experience it during college days, we can consider our job in the future very well. 
Third, we can make friends with through part-time job. We can do it in the college too. In this case, however, we canÅft make friends with other college students and people who are older than us. On the other hand, we can do it through part-time job.
I donÅft still work part-time, but I want to start it soon. If I start it, I want to be independent of my mother little by little and make friends with many people. So  I think that it is great  for college students to work part-time.
