I think that we have to prohibit people smoke in all restaurants in Japan. That is based on two ideas. 
 First of all, a restaurant is the place where we enjoy eating. Tobacco has extremely strong smell.  And smell represents more than 50 percents of taste. In addition, smoke spread in the air. So if someone smokes in a restaurant, we might not be able to taste accurately. And if we are not able to taste accurately, we might not enjoy eating. 
In the next, habit of smoking is harmful for our health. Recently, harm of smoke is noticed for a lot of people. It does not cause only smokerÅfs bad health, but also otherÅfs health. A restaurant is public space, so we should not cause trouble. For that reason, public spaces where we can have a smoke are decreasing. Restaurants in Japan should adopt this movement for the public benefit. And a lot of public spaces adopt this movement, smoker find the place where they can smoke difficult. If they are placed that situation long time, they donÅft smoke gradually. That might cause decrease of smoker. 
 ThatÅfs why I think that we have to prohibit people smoke in all restaurants in Japan
