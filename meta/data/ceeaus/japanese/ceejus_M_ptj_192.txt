I agree this opinion. This is because I think that we should have some social experiences while we are students. In my case, I teach various subjects to junior high school or high school students, so I can come to get along with in good means.  I can not only get along with them, but also have experiences to talk to their parents. In other words, I can ÅeÅfencounterÅfÅf various social circumstances.
Moreover, by having a part-time job, we can recognize the importance of money. And, in my case, I came to have a responsibility to money; for example, the way to use money, to think to money, etc.
But, the most important thing is to understand the border between study and my life ----part-time job or playing.  As we are college students, it is not until we precede study that we should have a part-time job. 
When we became college students, we tend to neglect study. But, university is not a place to play, but to study and actually we have studied hard to learn many new scholarships at university. I agree that we have a part-time job after understanding the ÅeÅfpolicyÅfÅf of students.
