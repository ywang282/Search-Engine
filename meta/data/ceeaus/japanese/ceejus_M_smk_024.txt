 I agree this idea. Many restaurants already make non-smoking area. So I think itÅfs easy because we only need one more step to ban smoking completely. IÅfll show you 3 reasons to support my opinions.
     First reason is health. As you know, smoking causes many diseases for example lung cancer. And it is said that if you smoke one cigarette, your life span will shorten in 50 seconds. I think dangerous risk is so openly said so smoking people must stop it and be careful of their health.
     Second reason is passive smoking. Even if you want not to smoke, you would breathe smoke because of the one smoker. This is dangerous not only adult but also children especially baby. They canÅft escape from smoke by themselves. So parents should avoid smoking. And passive smoking canÅft prevent by family only. We need all social peopleÅfs cooperation. So, smoking should be banned at all social place, of course including restaurant.
     Third reason is smells. Have you ever been to KARAOKE? DonÅft you feel uncomfortable by smell of cigarette? I have experienced that situation many times. Cigarette is annoying product. The existence itself is troublesome.
     For those reasons, I think all restaurants should ban smoking completely.
