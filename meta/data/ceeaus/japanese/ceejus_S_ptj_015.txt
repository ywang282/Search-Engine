I think this opinion is right and I have four reasons for it.

First, having a part-time job, college students can have good experiences that may be useful in the future. They can get wide experiences that can`t be experienced without doing a part-time job.

Second, it is said that they have a lot of free time.
Compared with high school students, college students don`t have to study weak subjects. So, they have more time mentally.
Moreover, they have less school lessons. So, they also have more time physically.

Third, because most of them are more than 17 years old, they can work for a variety of  jobs without age limits saying more than 17 years old.

Forth, they are always running short of money. 
When they go shopping with their friends or eat out, they spend money.
But the money they can spend during a month is limited. I think 3 hundred yen to 5 hundred yen without rent, electricity and so on is on average. 
If they have a part-time job, they can get money and supplement(?) their shortage of money. 
I have never do a part-time job, but I`d like to and must do it.
Last month, I went shopping with my friends three times, so I`m running short of money now. I feel College students can`t live happily without part-time jobs except for the rich. 

But, I think joining club activities and studying is also important for them. So working too much and not doing those is bad. It may be good to do things moderately.
