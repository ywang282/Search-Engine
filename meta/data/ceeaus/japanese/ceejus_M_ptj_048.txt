I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job , because having a part-time job helps living of my family. Actually I teach high-school student English once a week. Using money I earn, I spend the money on books, commuter ticket, cloth and so on. College students have a lot of chance to play with friends, so use a lot of money. They get some money from their parent, but the money is not usually enough. Most college students cannot make ends meet without a part-time job. 
Other reason I agree with the opinion is that having a part-time job is related with job when college students graduate from their college. I think that having a part-time job becomes study of society. In my case, by teaching student English I learn how difficult it is to teach study and by communicating with student, I build relationship of human. When I work at office, I have already learned the necessary way for society a little. I think that if a person does not have a part-time job, he or she is in trouble about work. That is why I want to have a lot of part-time job during life of college.
