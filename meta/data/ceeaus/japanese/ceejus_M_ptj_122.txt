"I agree with doing part-time job when we are in university. I have many reasons for my idea, but IÅfll show you three of them this time. I think they are very important.

 First, part-time job gives us many friends. It is nice to have many friends. When we are sad, they cheer us. Especially when we have some trouble and we want my classmates not to know about it, my friends in office can help us.

 Second, we can earn money. Perhaps, we have been given money by our parents. However we will have to earn money by ourselves for the future. We must manage the money. So we should learn how to use money which we get by ourselves while we are students.

 Third we can experience working. Part-time job isnÅft full-time job; however we can know pleasure and pain which we get at work. Our employer may praise or scold us. My part-time job was cooking at the restraint. The other day I was forced to quit my job by my manager. Because I made many mistakes and I made the manager very angry. More over, I went to work only one day a week. So the manager told me that he wanted me to quit this job. I knew that it is severe to work. But this experience will be useful.
