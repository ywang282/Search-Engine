Part-time job is important for the university student. Before working in society, as for us it is necessary to do part-time job. Because, if we work suddenly in the society whose responsibility is heavy, we are confused and can't work well. Furthermore, it will become valuable experience to work various jobs. Perhaps, after we start working as a society member, there may be no sufficient time in order to work or play variously. Therefore, to do part-time job is better in order to get used to busy society and have valuable experience which we may not experience in future. And we can make friends or seniors who are not friends in university or club. 

 But I don't think everything is good for college students. It is very bad that one starts working with vague feeling and retires at once. To retire dislike jobs at once have the man lose patience. If the man who lost patience start working in society, he can't probably continue his work. Recently, the number of young people who can't get a job is increasing. While the rate of unemployment of the middle age people keeps high percentage, this is also a serious problem. 

 It is very good that to experience various jobs and to earn by ourselves for parents even a little. But we should choose a job carefully and continue patiently.
