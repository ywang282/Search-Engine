"I agree with this statement.
One of the reasons for this is that collage students should understand
the meaning of working. For example, if we have a part time job, we need
to be punctual, to care of our appearance, and to greet everyone. So we
can know the manner of working, and we can act fittingly as workers.
Of course, when we graduate from college, we are regarded as workers by
persons around us, and we are demanded to do as workers naturally. So we
have to acquire the way of polite action by graduating from college.
It is true that we can learn about etiquette as persons who live in
society, in college group such as club activities, but we can experience
how hard it is to get money only when we work in fact. In fact, from my
experience of part time job, I realize that my thought about job was so
easy. If I did not have a part time job, I would go out in society with
wrong thought, face to unexpected hard society and be disappointed.
Therefore, some people say that part time job is a just way of getting
money, but I think that it is a important opportunity for us to learn
what is important to work.
