"I think that college students need to have part time jobs, because I believe that they should earn theirs living money.

 

Why should college student have part time job?  Certainly, first of all that college student must do at is studying hard to graduate from a university as soon as possibly, but they by donft pay theirs tuition fees by themselves. Tuition fees are paid by their parents. Furthermore, some college student rent one-room apartment, some of them donft pay fees that they rent apartment. Those fees also are paid by their parents.

 

Then, what should college student do? What can do to help their parents? That is earning their living money by themselves. We, college student, should consider that our parents donft force us to go college, but allow us to go it. In other words, we, college student, should gratitude to our parents for going college. So college student should reduce load of parents that they paid for us. We must do the minimum thing that we con do by ourselves.

 

Accordingly, I think that college students must have part time job to earn their living money for helping their parents, and study hard to graduate from a university.
