 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so.
 Firstly, it is because college students need money and take money to do something. For example, they use it when they go somewhere to play with friends, when they buy something such as drinks, household commodities, books, clothes and so on. If some of them belong to clubs, it also often costs them. In fact, I have a part-time job. This is because it costs to buy clothes and to play with friends of mine and I think IÅfll run short of money someday or soon when I donÅft do it.
 Secondly, it is because I think having a part-time job is useful for my long-life experience and I may be able to learn something by doing it. Only studying in college is dull. Since I had a part-time job and started, I could increase the sphere of activity, make friends who go to other colleges and exchange information.
 Lastly, it is because college students need to get gradually use to having and being conscious of responsibility. When they graduate from college and begin the work in society, they are left the responsible work and carry out their duties. When they go out into the world and begin the work, some may be puzzled because of their inexperience. In order not to be puzzled, it is useful to have a part-time job, I think.
