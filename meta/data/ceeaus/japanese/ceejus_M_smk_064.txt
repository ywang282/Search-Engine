
   I think smoking should be completely banned at all at the restaurant in Japan because I h
ave three below the opinion.
   First thing is that cigarette has it itself. It is the effect of passive smoking. Passive
 smoking injures the people around a smoker without their volition. And passive smoking has 
more harmful than active smoking. 
   Second, now most restaurant separate smoking seat and nonsmoking one. But it cannot separ
ate SMOKE. It floats anywhere. Only perfect locked room can do it, however, it doesnÅft real
ize in the restaurant in Japan. And more smoking seat often is near the bathroom in the Japa
nese restaurant. So many people-baby, child, pregnant woman, and elder- have to pass near th
e smoking seat, of course, if they donÅft smoke. I mean, nonsmokers feel so bad because of s
mokers. It resemble that the noise of in the train. For example, the loudly talk, the leak o
f sound from earphone and the call on the cell phone. 
   Finally, the climate in Japan is becoming Non-smoking. ÅgI was scared the light of cigare
tte.Åh This words is said by small boy and girl on the poster. In Japan now the goverment im
poses a duty on cigarettes. And already, smoking seats is excluding from many places.
   And first of all,smoking harms the smokers very much...
