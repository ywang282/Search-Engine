I agree to the idea ÅgIt is important for college students to have a part time job.Åh I have some reasons to agree to this.
First, I have part time jobs and if I didnÅft have part time jobs, I couldnÅft eat out, buy clothes, books and so on, join club activities, and even go to school. IÅfm not given any allowance from my parents so I have to work to get my lunch, train tickets, and happy memories.
Second, I can learn important skills of communication, computer and desk works and establish relations to senior people by working before I become an adult. We cannot learn these skills through only school life. In addition, earning money for myself, I need manage my expense so I became more careful than before.
Finally, I can feel a sense of achievement and fulfillment by working. When I get pay, and when I buy something on my own, I feel happy.
I think that a part time job is necessary rather than important. Part time jobs will bring up me.
