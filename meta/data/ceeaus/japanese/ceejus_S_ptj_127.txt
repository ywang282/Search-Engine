I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. But now, I have two part-time jobs Å| the karaoke studioÅfs clerk and the teacher of a cram school. I enjoy working and there are a lot of friends at work.

In addition to them, the salary is not low. I get about one hundred thousands yen per a month. And I use it for going abroad, buying clothes, playing and so on. The money is used for me and satisfies my life. From these points of view, having a part-time job is good for us. 

But there are some bad points. I work on the night shift. So I can not sleep at night. Because of it, my physical and mental conditions become worse and worse. For example, my condition of skin became bad and I get irritated easily.

And there are a lot of friends who are late for school around me. Most of them say ÅgI got up late because of part-time jobÅh And I often say that ,too.

The college students are not workers but people who study a lot of things. So we must not absent ourselves from studying. There are few part-time jobs which donÅft have a influence on studying. So I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
