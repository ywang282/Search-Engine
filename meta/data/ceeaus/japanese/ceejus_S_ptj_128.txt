I agree with part-time jobs of college students. We can experience jobs and other important things which we canÅft learn in the university.
Now I work at the hotel as a waitress for Weddings and parties. I have to be careful about my speech and manner more than usual. ItÅfs hard for me to acquire them perfectly but surely it will be useful after I get out into the world. And how to talk with my superiors is also important because there are people who are far older than me.
Next, the way to spend our time will be better. Part-time job takes long time, so weÅfd better finish our assignments or do something without wasting time. In fact, after I started my part-time job, I do everything more efficiently than before. But I think itÅfs not good to work too much because we can experience various things when we are college students and we can have chances to communicate with a lot of people. ItÅfs better to try actively what we want to do. 
Moreover, having a part-time job enables us to learn how to spend money well. We must control ourselves so as not to waste it when we get a lot of it. And if we find it happy to earn money, we will be motivated to work hardly in the future. 
Therefore, having a part-time job is good for college students.
