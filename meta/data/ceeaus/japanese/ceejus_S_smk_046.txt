Now in Japan when we go to restaurants we often find that most restaurants have a smoking room separated from a nonsmoking room.  If we would like to smoke at the table we should go into the smoking room and if we would not like to we should choose the nonsmoking room.  It is true that smoking is bad for health and troubles nonsmokers, but smoking in this separated room does not give nonsmokers any troubles.

No matter which he is a smoker or nonsmoker, a customer has a right to enjoy his eating in restaurant because he pays charge.  In other words, restaurants have a duty to satisfy their customers.  So restaurants should not ban smoking completely but ban smoking partly; make a smoking room and a nonsmoking room.  In the smoking room smokers enjoy both their eating and smoking, and in the nonsmoking room nonsmokers enjoy their eating without being troubled with smoke.  In fact, it has been a great advantage for restaurants to have a smoking room and a nonsmoking room.  Since smoking on the street became a crime, smokers have needed places to smoke more than before.  It goes without saying that smoking might profit restaurants.
