I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
First reason is that they need more and more money for various things.
For example, clothes, CDs, DVDs and of course textbooks.  But they
cannot get money easily.  So they will know the importance of money, and
acquire the sense of money.
Second, they will make many friends if they have a part-time job.  They
will be able to learn the way ob communication with other people.
Third reason (I think this is the most important reason.), college
students should have experience the labor before they start to work in
society in the future.  Through a part-time job, they can learn the
behavior and words toward their boss or seniors.
If they work as home teacher and so on, they will be able to become more
intelligence with their students.  If they work in a first-food
restaurant and so on, they will learn the behavior that make other
people feel good.
To be sure, some people say that they cannot have their own free time.
And other people say that they have to be to blame for their work.  But
it is necessary to try to overcome those difficulties.
Thus, it is very useful to have a part-time job.  So I agree to this
subject.
