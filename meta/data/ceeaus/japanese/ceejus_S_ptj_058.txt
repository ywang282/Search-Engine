"I agree this idea. To have a job is to citizen's duty.  I have a part-ti
me job as a teacher at a cramming school now. I was taught manner by oth
er teachers before I started working. This experience is useful for my d
aily life and future. To make relationship with my students who I don't 
know anything is also valuable.Å@When I think what I do to be believed b
y my students, I think of myself objectively. So I can find my good and 
bad points, and think what I do to be a good person.  Thus, to have a pa
rt-time job is not only the way to get money but also precious experienc
e. We can meet and help many people.
 I found it difficult to get money. So I make much of money better than 
before to start working. I save the money for my future. I'm making effo
rts to get money for my purpose that I will live in Kobe. It is also imp
ortant to make efforts for a purpose.
I also want to thank to my parents for working for my family, because I 
knew the difficulty to get money. Since these reason, I agree that the c
ollege students have a part-time job.
