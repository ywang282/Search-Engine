Whenever I go to a restaurant or that kind of place , I need to choose whether I smoke or not . That is to say, there are two types of seats , a seat of smoking and a seat of no smoking, in the restaurant and this is becoming common. However, smoke flows from smoking seat to no smoking seat, so we canÅft escape from smoke in spite of sitting in the seat of no smoking.

According to JT, or Japan Tobacco Inc., about 30 percent of people are smoking in Japan.  That is unbelievable for me, but anyway I hate smell of cigarettes. I canÅft stand that smell, and not a few people are the same I think.

Besides smoking is not good for the health, in addition, smoke by cigarette may cause not only smokers themselves, but also people around to be ill health.

ThatÅfs why it is unreasonable to smoke at the restaurant ! ÅgRestaurantÅh is the place where we enjoy eating. Flavor of the meal comes to nothing because of smoke ! If smokers would like to have a time of smoking after a meal, they should do it out of the restaurant. Nobody will welcome to have a meal with smelling the smoke. I really want smokers to understand that point and not to give trouble to us.

Though it may be severe for smokers, they must not be allowed to smoke in the restaurant, I think.
