I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
In Japan, a lot of college students have a part-time job. For example, they work as a waiter, a casher and a teacher of a cram school. There are many kinds of works that need people like college students as a worker. It is because they have a lot of time to use freely and they can be hired cheaply. But it is just a fact of today. We tend to think popular things are right but I donÅft think so.
Why are college students given a lot of time to use freely? I think, it is for a time doing what they canÅft do except now, not for a time earning money. It is sure to need much money for playing with friends but if they spend a lot of their time to earn money, it misplaces its priorities. Earning money is not bad thing, but neither is the most important thing. College students should spend more time reading many books, visiting many places and communicating someone. 
From these reasons, I donÅft think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
