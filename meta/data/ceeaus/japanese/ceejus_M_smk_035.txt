I donÅft like smoke. So I think smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant in Japan. There are some reasons.

First, people who smoke bother other people who donÅft smoke. For example, when I went to the restaurant with my friend, there were some people who smoked. Then, our pleasant dinner was over. We were tired of smoke. And when we got out the restaurant, our clothes smelled bad. I felt bad. Like this, smoking bother people.

Second, smoking is no good for health. I hear that not smoking peopleÅfs lungs are clean, but smoking peopleÅfs lungs are black. Once you begin to smoke, it takes several years to return to healthy lung again. And generally speaking, people who smoke tend to become lung cancer. To make matters worse, not smoking people may become disease by passive smoking. Especially, it is not good for childrenÅfs health. That is to say, smoking is bad for not only smoking people bad also not smoking people.

That is why, smoking is banned at the all restaurant. Smoking people should consider people who hate smoke. I think that all people, from children to old people, enjoy dinner and talking at the restaurant.
