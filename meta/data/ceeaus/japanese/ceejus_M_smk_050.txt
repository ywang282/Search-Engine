I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
Because, it is harmful for human to smoke. And smoking has many bad points.

First, smoking damages to our health. If you keep smoking in the future, you 
will lose your health. Your lung will be a sick. The survey shows that the 
cause of lung cancer is smoking. Because smoke contains much nicotine. 
Nicotine makes us excited. In addition, nicotine also causes other sick. For 
example, heart attack, high blood pressure . . . so on.

Second, smoking makes people who donÅft smoke uncomfortable. When I went to 
the restaurant last week, a man was smoking at the next table. The dinner 
was very delicious, but smoke made me uncomfortable. In addition, my brother 
suffered from cough. We wanted to eat in the more comfortable restaurant. I 
think that the restaurant should ban smoking. If smoking will be banned at 
all the restaurants in Japan, the restaurants will become cleaner than now. 
Because, people who smoke may throw the garbage after smoking on the floor. 
When other people see it, they may dislike the restaurant. The restaurant is 
damaged by smoking. It is also good for the restaurant to ban smoking.

Recently, many people think that it is important to live in the healthy 
life. They are also interested in the sick. So the news about the sick shows 
us the danger of smoking. Many doctors appeal that it is danger for human to 
smoke in the news. And they appeal that people should stop smoking soon. 
Smoking is bad only.

 So I think that smoking should be banned at the all restaurants in Japan.
