I think that college students should have a part-time job. Because college students can obtain great deal of experience by having part-time. It can know the importance of the thing to earn money. The chance that it meets various people increases, too.

Actually, knowing the importance of money , and doing a useless shopping disappeared as for me after it began to having part time. Moreover , I was able to make friends a lot with the people. I was able to make friends with the people of various universities. ItÅ@is really happy to speak friends of various universities with various topics. It is planned to travel to various places with the friends who happily because it because it works part-time, and to make a lot of memories. I think that it should experience these things before it starts one's adult life.  It can be thought that the part-time job is a practice before it finds employment. I think that it is very important to experience the part-time job in the school days for the above-mentioned reasons. Moreover, I think it is necessary. If the part-time job was not experienced, I was housebound. The part-time job develops the person, and gives me a lot of valuable experiences.

So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
