 What do you feel when you find the ash in your dishes?
Probably, almost all people answer that that accident makes them
displeasure.
I often see who says something when he finds some dust or hair in his dish.
On the other hand, nowadays we can hardly find the restaurant that is
forbade smoking.
   I think that to admit the smoking is as same as to admit putting in
the ash in dishes.
Maybe some smokers say that I never put in ash in dishes by my cigarette.
But, in the fact that, smokes from the cigarette consists not of many
detrimental thing but of many fine ash.
This fine ash floats in the air as smokes, and fall in dishes. Smoking
let us eat the ash.
   We are no duty to eat ash and endure the smell of smoking when you
are given a service in restaurant.
Besides, the owner of the restaurant should give the regard that all
customers have get the best service as far as possible, not to disturb
their mind by admitting smoking.
Then, some smokers may say that if smoking is banned in restaurant, it
makes us so uncomfortable.
Now, we will imagine, the child in front of you like insect like black
beetle and he says that if he canÅft touch that, he feel much bad.
You and that child eat with on same table and he put black insect on the
table.
Can you bear it? You certain say ÅgnoÅh.
This is a example. You should not smoking someone feel uncomfortable in
meal.
