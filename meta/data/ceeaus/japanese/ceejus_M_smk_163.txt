There are many arguments for and against smoking.

However, I agree this idea which smoking should be completely banned at
all the restaurants in Japan.

Firstly, I dislike the smell of the smoke and if I snuff up it, I maybe
lose my appetite.

Secondly, smoking cause various disease such as lung cancer , stroke,
asthma.

Smoker often cause these disease but if I snuff up smoking, I also cause
such disease

Moreover, passive smoker are more harmful than smoker. Because, passive
smoking contain more harmful materials than smoking.

So, it is very unfair. Why I am damaged by smoker? I am very angry when
people walk with smoke.

Finally, Smoking sometimes wound others badly.

For instantly, my junior high school friend has been troubled with
asthma for long years. One day I and he go to the shopping. When we meet
smokers in the restaurant, my friend suffer from smoke and finally his
breathing is very slow and weakened. So, I take him into the hospital.

So, I perfectly agree that smoking should be banned at the restaurants
in Japan.
