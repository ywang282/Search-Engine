I agree with this topix. College student have to get a job soon after
they graduate college. If they don't know about job at all, they were
confused with what they should do. I think, however, if they have some
experience, they natulaly start to do a job. Moreover, part time job
tells us the system of our economic society. Adult say "don't group part
time job and regular job". It is true, but without part time job, we
can't know actual economy at all. I heard that in foreign college,
student pay school expenses themselves. Therefore almost of them have a
 parttime job. So they treasure their lecture. In contrast, in japan,
including me, parent pay school expenses. So we tend to think lecture is
free and don't treasure it. Paying expenses is very dificult for me, so
we shold gratitude for our parents. Insted of that, I think we should
know the importance of money. trough part time job, We can know little
about that. now I don't have part time job, but at no distant date, I
want to do a part time job. I plan to do a home teacher.  With this job,
I want to experience little economic society and know the importance of
money.
