I am opposite to the opinion. Because there is a person who wants smoking when eating in the restaurants. Recently, I think that there are many things banned for smoking people. For the our body, smoking may harmful but I think that the people who want to smoke the cigarette can smoking. I think the most important thing is to separate the smoking people and the non smoking people. It is necessary to have manners both smoking people and non smoking people. I think that it is necessary to prevent smoke from going to the non smoking people, especially children and pregnant woman. If the smoke go to them, smoking people should be endured to smoke the cigarette. When the people want smoking without careful in the restaurants, they can go to the free-smoking restaurants now. I think that everyone has the right to enjoy in the restaurants. If everyone keep a little manners, we will have a enjoy time in the restaurants. The trend of ban the smoking is risen for the health, but I think that the side of restaurants also should consider the customer for separate the smoke. Non smoking people donÅft complain of smoking if the smoke donÅft come. In such a reason, I am opposite to the opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
