Restaurants are the places where we enjoy dishesf pleasant smell, good
flavor, conversation with friend and so on. When someone begin smoking
in the restaurant, people surrounded him must be hurt their feelings
because the smoke makes the dishesf tastes and the atmosphere in the
restaurant bad. So the restaurantfs customers are not satisfied in
dishes. This might be responsible for the restaurantfs unpopularity.  In
terms of health, the effect of passive smoking on human is grater
the that of inhaling smoking. In other words, passive smokers are apt to
be taken ills including cancer of the lungs. If someone begin smoking in
public space, he do damage to people who surrounded him. Namely, smokers
who smoke in a crowded space, they reduce the length of other peoplefs
life. How guilty it is! Smokers must be considered the place for smoking
wherever they are.Recently, there are many restaurants that make smoking
sections. But nonsmokers often sit down and eat in the smoking sections
if nonsmoking sectionsf seat is filled. So if smokers want to smoke,
they should be outside the restaurant, or the master of   the restaurant
is ought to provide the smoking area for only smokers. If so, nonsmokers
cannot smoke passively.
