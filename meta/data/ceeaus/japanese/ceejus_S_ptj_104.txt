"Today, I want to talk about this topic as the affirmative side.
 First of all, what is the part-time job for the college students? I
think itÅfs the good opportunity to touch our society before we go out
the society. From that, they can get the skill, for example,
communication with their customer, cooking, or how to teach something to
someone and so on. Moreover we can actually feel social situation, and
know the significance of earning money.
 However some people said that students have to work hard and late, and
the environment in their workplace sometimes bad, for example smoking,
drinking or something like that. So they disagree this topic because the
part-time job will be obstacle for students to study.
 Surely the main thing for the college students is studying in their
college days. I admit this point. But I believe it doesnÅft mean all
students have to do is only such thing. After the graduation and going
out the society, we need not only knowledge we can get in universities
but also other skill. Only knowledge itÅfs not enough. When you work in
your company, you must negotiate with your clients, and keep the good
relationship with your colleague. Such skill canÅft get from only
universities. If we can get the basis of such skills during
universities, we can quickly fit our society when we start working.
 So to compare advantages and disadvantages, I believe the part-time job
is important for college students as the preparation for working
actually in our society."
