"I agree with first statment.  Because college students need money and
need to practice work.
 First, we are given free time like after school and holidays.  It is
free for each other to past this time.  For example, to club, to study,
to hobby, and to playing with friends.  But it takes much money to do
those.  I think that earning moneys is necessary to canpus life.  But,
most necessary thing for college students is to keep time to study.  We
have to plan studying,  and after this,  make time to have a part-time job.
 Next,  I think that most college students are short of the experience
of work.  Because it is impossible to have a part-time job in many high
school.  But,  we are allowed it in university.  I think that college
students need to practice work.  Because this experiments will be
necessary after graduating university.
 I think that the most imporant thing is to keep time to study and have
various experiments till graduating university.  If we could do first
thing, I agree with this statement.
