 I agree with the statement, ÅgIt is important for collage students to have a part-time job.Åh I have two big reasons. I think about it recently, too.
First, it is because I think that we should understand that earning much money is very hard before working in a society. For example, when we are scolded to our boss, we will have angry or feel shock, and we want to quit. But if we quit, we cannot earn much money and we will be in trouble. So we can learn that putting up with anger is important and understand real value of money. And we will think that we use money importantly. Then, we can use much money that we earned without minding. For example, we can watch many movies, travel around the world, go to a high-class restaurant, and buy expensive clothes, shoes, hats, jewels, bags, cosmetics, and so onÅc
Second, it is the reason why our human relations spread. In a collage, there are a lot of people. So we can get more friends after entering a collage than before it. But if we have a part-time job, we can spread our human relations more!! These relations help our growth.
Therefore, I think that it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.
