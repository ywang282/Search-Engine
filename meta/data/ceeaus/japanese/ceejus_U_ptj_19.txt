I think itÅfs important for college students to do a part time job. There are three reasons.

First, we need much money for going to university. We have to pay school expenses, and the rent or great travel expenses. I think that we shouldnÅft be unconcerned to our own household economy, and we should earn money even if it is a little. 

Second, this is the most important reason, we can experience some jobs. When we become adults and start to work, we may be confused. We suddenly become responsible, are often scolded, and get nervous. Some of us may lose the way to work. This is because we can never know the difficulties of working till we work. But, if we have some experiences of working, those will surely help us to know how to behave for the occasions.

Third, we can meet various people through part time jobs. I think itÅfs very nice thing. I have made friends with a man who was over thirty. I was affected by him in lots of things. His story is always very interesting for me because we have lived quite different lives. I feel very happy to do part time jobs when I can see people like this man

These are the reasons why I recommend doing part time jobs to college students. I especially regard part time jobs as opportunities for practicing working and learning society. So, I think itÅfs very important and valuable for college students to do a part time job.
