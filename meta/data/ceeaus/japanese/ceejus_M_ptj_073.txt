I think that to do a part time job is good. Because I can do various experience through work, know serious of earnings of money and work with different generation. Now, I do a part time job in the cram school and teach mathematics. I have to do the explanation that understands easily. But that is difficult. It needs explanation skill. This skill will be useful in the future like presentation for anything. I gave one example, but other job needs various abilities.  
Moreover, I think that it can think about money that can be obtained by working. Money that had been spent before it works part-time is all money that parents earned.
Therefore, the importance of money is not very understood. I will not have a big regret if the importance of money is understood if money is spent too much. And, if it knew it, it will try to think about the usage of money. I think that the amount of people spends much money than they has spent though they doesn't spend a lot between university students. Therefore, it is important to know the importance of money.
 There might be other things what obtained by working part-time. Therefore, I think that it is good the part-time job of the university student.
