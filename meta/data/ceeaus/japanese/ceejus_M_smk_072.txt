Smoking and breathing the smoke are bad for our health. When someone smokes, people around him breathe the smoke. If it occurred at the restaurant, the smoke would prevent them from enjoying meal because they donÅft feel the smell and the taste very well. Moreover, they may feel uncomfortable.

In case of me, I hate tobacco and the smoke. When my parents smoke during my meal, I feel uncomfortable. I get them not to smoke while I eat meal. At the restaurant, I make it a rule to choice the no smoking area. However, when no smoking area is full, I sit the smoking area unwillingly. Then I canÅft enjoy meal. I go to the restaurant to enjoy meal. I want to eat at home rather than eating meal at the smoking area.

The smoke not only prevent enjoying meal but also is bad for our health. Smoking people donÅft have a right to prevent enjoying meal and influence the other peopleÅfs health. They should consider the environment and people around them. If they did so, they would realize that they should not smoke at the restaurant. If the restaurant banned smoking, people who are like me enjoy meal. So, smoking should be banned at the restaurant.
