I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan. All the managers of the restaurants should not allow their guests to smoke in the restaurant. I have two reasons why I think so. 

Firstly, I donÅft like smoking itself. It makes our bodies unhealthy. Our teeth will be stained. We will damage our throat. And, furthermore, the risk that we get cancer in our lung will become higher than those who donÅft smoke. I think smoking brings us nothing but bad things.

The second reason why I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan is that those who are near the person who is smoking will never feel comfortable. Smoke will hurt their throat and eyes. Moreover, smoke which other persons breathe in is more harmful than that the person himself breathes in. I felt very discomfort when my friend smoked near me.

So, for these two reasons, I hope that smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in Japan.
