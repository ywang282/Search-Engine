 First, I know there are many people who donÅft like the smell of 
cigarettes. The restaurants where smoking is not banned would be filled with 
the smell, so people who donÅft like it would hesitate to inter the 
restaurant. Even if they enter the restaurant they would not feel good. 
Perhaps they may feel the food is not so delicious, just because the smell 
of smoking. It would also be the same at restaurants where smoking were half 
banned, because people who sit next to the smoking area, would smell the 
unpleasant smell a little. I think people should avoid causing other people 
troubles as possible as they can. And it may be very easy to stop smoking 
only when you are at table.

 The second is that second-hand smoking would cause lung cancer, stomach 
cancer and so on. Of course smoking also cause these illness, but 
second-hand smoking is more likely to cause them. IsnÅft it strange that 
people who like smoking cause other peopleÅfs health to be bad? No one would 
be able to take responsibility for other peopleÅfs health. So I believe it 
should not be allowed.

 In addition, it would also be good for smoking people to ban smoking at 
restaurant. They would able to save some cigarettes, not only bad for there 
health but also a very expensive substance.

 For these reasons I think this idea should be carried out.
