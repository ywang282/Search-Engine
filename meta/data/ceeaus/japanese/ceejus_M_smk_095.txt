I think we have to prohibit smoking in the restaurant, because the restaurant is the place where we should have a meal. The smoke prevents you from smelling the dishes and. You canft taste the meal so much. So you must feel uncomfortable if someone smokes in front of our table.

Not only the customers but also the managers dislike smoking in the restaurant, for the managers think smokers canft taste the delicious dishes very much. The managers do their best for the customer to enjoy their dinner. So the managers are very sorrowful if the customersf interest is not the meal but the smoke. 

However the smoke also disturbs people around the smoker. It makes the managers very angry. Because the customers think the service of the restaurant is worse and they will never go to the restaurant. 

It is very irritated for me to see a man smoking in the public place like the restaurant. Donft the smokers recognize their behaviors make other people unpleasant? Yes, they do, however they arenft considerate. If they are more considerate, they donft, for instance, smoke walking or throw away a cigarette. Sadly, however, there are few considerate people, so smoking in the public place must be prohibited.
