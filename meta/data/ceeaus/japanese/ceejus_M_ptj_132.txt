"I donft agree that college students work part time. It is because two reason.

In the first place, college students have to study hard. Once, they studied hard to entrance examination. Why they wanted to pass the entrance exam? It is they wanted to translate dreams into a reality. So if they want to do that still now, they have to continue studying even now. But they canft study hard if they work part time. They canft study hard because they canft take time to do so. If they work part time hard, he canft study and they fail them test.  

In the second place, part time job make some money. You know it is a little money, but it is a lot of money for college students. Most of college students spend money on pleasure and their hobby. Only a part of students saves money. If you spend all your money, you will have nothing. I think that young people should give themselves up to sports, studying, or club activities. Surely, money is important in our life, but it is not everything. You should not always work part time, or your heat will be satisfied. 

Thatfs why‡Tdonft agree that college students work part time.
