"I agree with the idea that college students have a part-time job.

I have two reasons about the opinion.

 

First, I think that most of college students are about 18 years old. So, we are enough old to be independent with our parents about money.

Until I was high school student, my parents gave me money to play with my friends and buy clothes. Because my high school banned to have part time job. 

SO I can't get money by myself. But, in our college we are allowed to take part-time job. 

I think we must do our own things by myself. We will have to be independent from our parents someday.

 

Second, to have various social experiences through part-time job is very important.

My parents work every day for us, but we don't know how hard to work every day is. We have to understand how hard and appreciate my parents.

And, we can contact with people that have different ideas from us through part-time job.

We had better to have various ideas and experiences to become decent people.

We will have new idea from work.

More ideas we have, more decent we are.

 

So I agree with the idea that it is important to have a part time job.
