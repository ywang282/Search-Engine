I donÅft agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

 

First of all, nonsmokers are unwilling for a smoker to smoke near them because the smoke of tobacco is harmful to our health. So if there are nonsmoking seats, they would not have any trouble. Fortunately, in Japan, most of restaurants have smoking seats today.

When we enter a restaurant, a clerk always asks us whether we smoke or not. When all nonsmoking seats are taken, we have to wait until a seat comes open or we have to look for another restaurant whose nonsmoking seat is open. But such case is unusual. 

 

Second, smokers have a right to smoke at a restaurant. Banning smoking at all the restaurants is unfair, and it invades their right. If their frustration piled up by not smoking, they might have a traffic accident or fall in something. So we allow them to smoke at all the restaurants, as long as they smoke at a smoking seat. And restaurants must separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats as much as they can, and change the wind of air conditioners so that the smoke would not go to the nonsmoking seats. 

 

This is why I never consent to banning smoking at all the restaurants in Japan.
