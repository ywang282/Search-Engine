  I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the
 restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons why I agree this. First,
 smoking is very bad for not only smokersf health, but also non
 smokersf health. From adult to child, even pregnant motherfs baby, we are always faced with danger. Tobacco fumes cause various diseases.
 For instance, lung cancer, stomach cancer, heart break and so on.
 These diseases are very bad for our body. There is possibility that patients who have got these diseases will die because of these
 diseases. Non smokersf possibilities of getting these diseases are higher than smokersf. So, smoking should be banned at all the
 restaurants in Japan to protect from bad fumes. 
   Second reason why Iagree this is that Japanese smokersf manner is too
bad.
  There are alot of cigarette ends everywhere. Cigarette ends are one of the causes which invite environmental problems. Tobacco fumesf smell is too bad. We canft eat dishes deliciously because of bad tobacco fumesf smells. Even if restaurants divided tables into smoking seats and non smoking seats, we probably feel bad smells. So, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
   In this way, Iagree that we should completely ban smoking at all the
restaurants. If this realizes, we will be able to eat dishes comfortably atrestaurants in Japan!
