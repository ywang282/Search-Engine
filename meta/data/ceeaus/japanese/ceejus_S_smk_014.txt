I take objection to this opinion. I think it is too severe for smoker. Recently smoking has been regulated almost everywhere. Itfs difficult to smoke easily. However, if smoking is completely banned at also restaurant, smoker will be irritated.  
 Because they have no place to smoke, they smoke at restaurants, coffee shop and smoking room. In fact, itfs true that smoking is harmful to health. But itfs their own responsibility. There are surely many smokers who arenft sensible. Some people smoke even at nonsmoking area, are smoking on the street and throw away a cigarette everywhere without thinking. They should be care about people around. But not every smoker is insensible. Some smokers obey the rule.
 People smoke because they are under a lot of stress. There are many difficulties in todayfs world. But we must keep on fighting them. Cigarette is the only way to reduce stress for smoker. So if it is taken away, what should smokers do? I think that the recent regulation is overrun. I do not smoke. My friends say they donft like people smoking. Ifm different from them. I donft care about smoking very much. Itfs not strange for adult to smoke, I think so. 
 Todayes Japan is healthy oriented. So smoking is hated more. Therefs the way it goes.
