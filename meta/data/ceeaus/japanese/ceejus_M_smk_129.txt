Restaurants in where all people enjoy dishes are not private place but public place.

It is various people in there; adults and children, family and couple, gentle men and women, noisy men and women, smoker and non-smoker, for instance. So if you have lunch in restaurant, you should think feelings of around people in there. If you are smoker, it is most important that think thinking of non-smoker.  In fact, I think smoke of cigarettes harm taste of foods. And smoke of cigarettes harms growth of children in restaurant.  People who want to smoke should smoke out of room after mealtime. Then smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 

For example, McDonaldÅfs near my home prohibits smoking in store because McDonaldÅfs think that smoke is obstacle for good taste of hamburger. It is very good idea!

And it is truth for smoker that smoke harms dishes. So in now, some restaurants have sheets for smoker, but all restaurants should abolish the sheet, if they want all people to enjoy good dishes.  Finally I want all restaurants to prohibit smoking in it and all people agree this thinking and enjoy food and conversation peaceful, cheerful in it.
