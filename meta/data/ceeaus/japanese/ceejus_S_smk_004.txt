I donÅft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons.
	First, smokers cannot eat out and enjoy with their friends if smoking is controlled at restaurants. These days smoking is prohibited at many restaurants and cafes. My family and some friends are also smokers so when I go out with them, we have to search the restaurants where we are allowed smoking. I let them smoke at least when we rest. Surely smokes may be unpleasant for people who donÅft smoke. However, if so, restaurants have only to part smoking section and nonsmoking section so I think smoking donÅft need to be banned.
	Second, if smoking is prohibited, people smoke out of buildings and town become unsanitary. When I went to New York, people smoke on the street because smoking is controlled at almost buildings. Therefore many cigarette butts are on the street. Accordingly that people are allowed smoking in the buildings is better than that street become dirty.
	By these reasons, I donÅft think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. The best way for smokers and nonsmokers is the way to part smoking area and nonsmoking area. If so, we can choose which area we stay and people who donÅft smoke also eat and rest comfortably.
