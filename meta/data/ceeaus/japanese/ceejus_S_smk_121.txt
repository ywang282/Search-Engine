I donft agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I donft smoke and donft want to breathe the smoke that someone blows, but this idea is very excessive. We should take smokerfs feelings into consideration, and that idea completely ignores their feelings.

 Certainly, I can understand the idea that no-smokers want to keep away smoke from them, because I sometimes think so. Tobaccoes smoke has many problems. For example tobaccofs smoke does a lot of damage to our health. The possibility that you may get cancer and a lot of other illness increases very much by breathing tobaccofs smoke. In addition to this fact, smoke does the same damage to secondary smoker, so no-smoker but secondary smoker is as good as smoker. From a viewpoint of no-smoker, that they canft allow existence of smoke is convinced. 

 Smoker enjoys smoking and look forward to smoking, but when they go to a restaurant, if smoking is completely banned, they canft enjoy and relax. Considering both sidesf opinion, the idea that we make the smoking place that is completely isolated from no-smoking places and of course they can eat is best.

 Restaurants should be the place that all people enjoy and relax, so smoker should care about no-smokerfs feelings and no-smoker mustnft exclude smoker from restaurant.
