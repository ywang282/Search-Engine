 Eating is one of the most important things in our lives. By eating, we can get energy and we can also have a good time with our family and friends. Eating is very enjoyable.

 But when someone around me begins to smoke, smoking smell prevents me from enjoying eating any more. That often happens in a restaurant. Although some restaurants separate smoking area, itÅfs still not enough effective.

 So I think we should ban smoking in a restaurant. This has two merits. First, we can keep a good health. Smoking is bad for our health and some people canÅft stand smoking smell. If one person smokes in a restaurant, the smoke will reduce their good health of all the people there because of second-handed smoking. Second-handed smoking is worse for health than first-handed smoking. In short, smoking gives bad effects on people around you. Second, we can enjoy eating more. A restaurant is where we enjoy eating and communication with others. Without smoking people, we could enjoy taste and flavor of foods ,and more conversation with our companies.Å@

Å@However, this plan may make smoking people angry and they may lose their joy of smoking. But if we take this plan, smoking people will not have to mind other peopleÅfs feelings and smoking people have a chance to give up smoking. Smoking causes addiction so smoking people relatively canÅft stop smoking by themselves. I think they can find another present time with their family or friends because giving up smoking spares them time and money. 

Moreover, smoking in a restaurant is nothing but troublesome thing for non-smoking people. In my opinion, everyone will be happy if smoking is banned in a restaurant.
