I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. 
There are two reasons. First I think so that is personal reason. That is I hate smoking, tobaccoÅfs smell and that smoke. I come to feel sick just to smell the tobacco. And the restaurant is the place that to eat lunch and dinner. When I eat a meal I want to be relaxed. But there are smokers same place I canÅft be relaxed. There will be the person who thinks so. So I hate smoking. Second tobaccoÅfs smoke do harm to non-smoker. Passive smoking is worse non-smoker. And it is cause lung cancer. So People who take care of health become unhealthy because tobaccoÅfs smoke.
 But smokers may say that they have freedom to smoke. That is surely right. I think, however, they donÅft have the right that may trouble another person. And they donÅft have the right to hurt the health of another person. In other words they should mind another person. And I think that when smokers want to smoke at a restaurant they go to outside a restaurant and smoke there.
 For there reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
