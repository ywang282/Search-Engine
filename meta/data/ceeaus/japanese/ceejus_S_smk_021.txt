I agreed that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
 ‚she risks of passive smoking are pointed out in recent years. Most of people know smoking cause lung cancer. So, smokers do while knowing it. But, in fact, the risk of lung cancer of passive smoking is higher than that of smoking, because the smoke which appears from a cigarette includes more toxic substance than the smoke which the smoker breathes. This is serious for a pregnant woman. Though the pregnant woman does not smoke, a disease and an obstacle occur to the child who has been produced by passive smoking, and, in the case of the worst, miscarriage and to have a baby born dead occur.
Recently, some shops, restaurants and public accommodations decide to separate smokers and nonsmokers in the same room. And at the station, a specific smoking place is made. But these are incomplete separations. Smoke of a cigarette comes to a non-smoking section by wind and when nonsmokers go along the neighborhood, they breathe the smoke of the cigarette. I think if the risk of passive smoking occurs a little, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
