"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time-job. There are three reasons why I think so. 

The first reason is that we can earn money by ourselves through a part-time-job, and we can buy what we want, do what we need to. I have a part-time-job now, and get a little money. I use the money for studying Ågfinancial plannerÅh, and my clothes. 

The second reason is that we can experience the roll of working adults. I am working at a convenience store near my home now. The work is not so easy but this experience will help me to work as a working adult after I graduate from our college. 

The third reason is that the money and experience we can get through a part-time-job help us to become independent. We cannot rely on our parents forever. We have to prepare for the independence, or we cannot establish ourselves.

After all, a part-time-job is not only for money but also for experience Of course, we are students, and we have to study. Perhaps, some students donÅft have enough time or need not to work, but I think that we should have a part-time-job to get a wide field of vision.
