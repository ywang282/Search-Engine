I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.Several of ÇçÇô friends who are smokinÇá cigarette say that it is a kind of puff to smoke a cigarette.Therefore, since it thinks that a restaurant is also a place which it has not only in the place which has a meal,I think that it is not necessary to make it prohibition of smoking completely at a restaurant.However, probably, partly, there are some persons who think that a cigarette is disagreeable. Therefore, although the nonsmoking seat is prepared, since it is meaningless if it is few at a restaurant from the first and a nonsmoking seat fills, you should cope with increasing a nonsmoking seat more etc.
Moreover, there may be an opinion which cares about the manners side that what is necessary is just to smoke a cigarette to except during a meal,but since it thinks that tobacco is a part of a break as stated also like the point, I think that the opinion does not have effect.Probably, the blanket ban in our country will be too severe. 
I am opposed to the blanket ban of the tobacco in Japan from these things.
