I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I think smoking should be strictly controlled by the law. I have some friends who smoke and my father smokes, too. I donÅft like the smell of tobacco. I think there are a lot of people who dislike the smell likely to me.
 Generally speaking, tobacco do people harm and give no benefit. Smoking increase risk of disease, lung cancer and those who are smoking is likely to die more early than people who arenÅft. But even if we donÅft smoke, we actually suffer from harm by smoke from the smoking people. At restaurants, many people including children and old people have lunch or dinner. So if there are people of smoking at restaurants, they do children and old people harm before notice it. This is very bad thing for children to grow. You may think there are two kinds of seat at restaurant, smoking seat and nonsmoking seat, but we canÅft say we are completely protected from the smoke. Unfortunately, sometimes the nonsmoking seats are filled and we have to sit at the smoking seat.
 So I agree with that statement. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, less and less people may be smoking and I wish it would be true.
