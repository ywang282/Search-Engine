 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons for this.
 First, the dishes would be bad by smoking. We should make a place that everyone can enjoy and eat deliciously.
 Second, other customers may donÅft like and smoking will be bad for them. 
 But if smoking is completely banned, smokers will be offended. So I think it is good that they make smoking room. It is completely closed like toilet. 
 But I donÅft understand why they sell tobaccos. It is bad for health. Do they want to kill people? If all people come not to smoke, people who have disease would rapidly reduce.
 So even if smokers were offended, we might have to ban smoking at all area of all the restaurants in Japan.
 For these reasons, I think the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan is very good.
 I wish tobacco were disappeared.
