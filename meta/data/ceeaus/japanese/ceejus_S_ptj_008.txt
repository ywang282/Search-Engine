I disagree with the opinion that it is important for university students to have a part time job. There are three reasons for this.
First, they were admitted to their university not to have a part time job but to learn. Though this is an obvious fact, some of them devote themselves to work and donÅft study at all. They are too busy and tired to study. They also donÅft have enough time to study. I think they have forgotten the real purpose.
Second, university students are given the best opportunity to become a cultured person and acquire some skills which will become useful in the future. If they hope, they can try everything, for example, going to English conversation schools and cooking schools, seeing movies, reading books, traveling abroad and so on. Luckily, there are special discounts for them when they do such activities. It is difficult for them to do such things after graduating from university and start to work.
Third, it is important to join club activities. Many people who are the same level as you come to universities from all of Japan. They may give you a good stimulus more than ever, so you should become a friend with them. In order to make such friends, you should join club activities at university positively rather than have a part time job.
For these reasons, I think university students shouldnÅft have a part time job and should do things they can do only now.
