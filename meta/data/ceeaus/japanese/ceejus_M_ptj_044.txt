Just now, I donÅft have a part-time job. However, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons.

First, we need much money during our being students. We have to buy some books for the classes, and pay education money. Especially, if we live alone, we have to pay the money for the apartment and buy foods. We also want to buy the cloths.

Next, a part-time job is social experience. Through a part-time job, we meet a lot of people. So we can learn a lot of things. For example, rules of the society and manner and so on. We can make friends with people who work with, too. We can expand other 

human relationship.

Third, we can learn importance of money. When we were high school students, we got some money from our parents. Then, we used the money without thinking of our parentsÅf difficulty of earning the money. So, by working hard and getting the money, we think of importance of the money for the first time. We should be independent of our parents.

That is why, I think itÅfs important to have a part-time job among we are college students.
