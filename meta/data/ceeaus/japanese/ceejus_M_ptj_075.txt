   I agree with this opinion for the following reasons.
   First, I think doing a part-time job means preparation for working in
society. When you do a part-time job, you can learn relationship between
you and other people who work at the same corporation. For example, you
have to respect your boss, if you hate him or her. You have to drink
with old persons in the same corporation, if you hate them. You can also
learn about responsibility for your action and yourself. In a
corporation, you have a role to work. If you donÅft work well, this
corporation wonÅft work well too. You have to work well and have good
results.
   Second, you can buy something you want. If you join a jazz club, you
need instruments. For example, it is guitar, bass, violin, and so on. If
you join a tennis team, you need rackets, tennis balls and uniforms. If
you join an adventure club, you need a knapsack, and shoes which are
very strong enough to survive hiking. If you do a part-time job and earn
money, you can buy them without your parentsÅf help. It is important for
college students because it can lead independence against their parents.
