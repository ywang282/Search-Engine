Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
I agree this topic.
First of all, non-smokers dislike cigarette smoke. If smoking doesnÅft be banned at the restaurant, they must smell it and their clothes will begin to smell of it. It is nothing but quite painful for them that smokers sit near their table. 
Some restaurants separate the place where guests can smoke and canÅft smoke. However, non-smokers sometimes must seat at the place where guests can smoke there when the seats and guests are almost full. 
Secondly, smoking is not healthy. There is no need to smoke at all. Everyone, rather, had better stop smoking. I hope so.
For the reasons stated above, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
