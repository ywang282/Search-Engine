I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking.
 First, my family and I donft smoke, so I smell the little flavor of cigarettes. And I donft like it very much. I think many people also donft like it. Moreover, because of the smell of cigarettes, we canft taste the meal at a restaurant and we canft eat delicious meal. So it is important to ban smoking at all restaurants.
 Secondly, there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at some restaurants. When nonsmoking seats are full and I donft want to wait, I may go to smoking seats. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, I may sit soon at nonsmoking seats.
Finally, I think that if the place where we can smoke decrease, people who stop smoking increase. And we can live more comfortable than today. For example, we may not smell the flavor of cigarettes at a station or in the city. In addition to that, illnesses such as lung cancer decrease. Man say cigarettes do harm for health. Smoking has a bad effect not only on smoker but also on non-smoker.
