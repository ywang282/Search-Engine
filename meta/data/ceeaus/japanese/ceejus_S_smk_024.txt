 I quite agree with this idea.
  First of all, I a nonsmoker dare say that nonsmoking seats is almost meaningless. If a restaurant is big, and nonsmoking seats are separated enough from smoking seats, there is no problem. But such a case is really unusual. Most restaurants have nonsmoking seats which are close enough to smoking seats that smoke of cigarettes easily flow there.
 Besides, in the case that there is no seat but a smoking seat, you had better be ready to have your meal ruined. When I sat on a smoking seat and started to drink some coffee at a cafe in the morning before, I come near to shouting, ÅgHow can you enjoy your coffee with cigarettes?Åh Needless to say, breathing smoke of them is nothing but unpleasant. Why do we nonsmokers have to experience such a feeling in spite of paying as much as smokers? I have often wanted to say that they should pay a part of our charge.
 There is also a problem about health. It is none of my business that they do harm to themselves. But if they harm to us, I canÅft overlook it. There are people who are sensitive to smoke of cigarettes such as a little child, an expectant mother, a sick man and so on. Passive smoking at restaurants possibly becomes a cause of a serious situation.
 ThatÅfs why I support the idea.
