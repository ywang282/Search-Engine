I think itÅfs good for collage students to do part-time job. Because collage students have to work to live after they graduate from collage. I think they can get a lot of important things that they can learn from through to do part-time job and they notice this fact after they graduate from collage. And I think they have more free time than high school students, so they can do part-time job more easily than high school students. Moreover, if they do part-time job, they get more friends than if they donÅft because they meet people not only at collage or club activities but also at working place. IÅfm collage student now, but IÅfve never done part-time job. I want to begin to part-time job as soon as possible because I think if IÅfll have never done part-time job by the time I graduate from collage, I wonÅft be able to become well member of society. But I think if collage student does too much part-time job to study enough, he or she must stop doing part-time job. Of course, students must study. If one student quit studying, he or she is no longer student
. ItÅfs stupid for students only to do part-time job and not to study at all. So student should do part-time job as long as it doesnÅft prevent student from studying because their main job is studying.
