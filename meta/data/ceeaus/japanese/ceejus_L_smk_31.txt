I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
It is fact that many people donÅft like smoke of tobacco and donÅft want to be by the smoker.
So, smoke of tobacco causes heavy damage not only to the smoker but also to people in surroundings.
Nicotine and tar are very poisonous.
People donÅft need not to smoke.
But smoking should not be ÅgcompletelyÅh banned at all the restaurants, because all the restaurants become unpleasant places for the smoker.
People fill the desire of some level by eating. In such a meaning, all the restaurants are not only a place to eat.
However, if smoking is banned at all the restaurants, the smoker is uncomfortable and dissatisfied.
It is the best that no one smokes, but since tobacco exists in this world, it is impossible.
The opinion of people who doesnÅft smoke should be insisted, but the opinion of the smoker should be insisted, too.
So that all the people who use a restaurant are comfortable, if smoking room and not smoking room are separated, there is no problem. 
So, I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
