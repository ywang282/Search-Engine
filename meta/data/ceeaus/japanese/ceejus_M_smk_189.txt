I think that it is natural to prohibit from smoking in public placesÅ\res
taurants, station and so on. To be honest, it is because I dislike others to s
moke in the room. One reason, I hate a nasty smell of smoking. Even if only I 
have the bad smell of smoking, I am tired of it. The smoke does health harm by
 toxic chemicals in tobacco. Another reason, I think that some people are bad 
mannered when they smoke. They seem to be careless about whether their smoke i
s bothered other people. I think that they have to be more careful for others 
around them, and moreover that they should keep off smoking the least at meals
. It spoils delicious foods! Besides I think that they are bad mannered outdoo
rs, for example, at the station and on the street. On the street they often se
em to throw away cigarette butt. Although from the beginning it is banned to w
alk with smoking, some people smoke, and throw it away. Thus smoking annoys ot
her people, and there is no end to be bad mannered. So I think that they must 
look back their smoking manner before they complain about ÅgNo smokingÅh.
