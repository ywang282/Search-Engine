Nowadays, as many people notice that smoking has a bad influence on not only smoker but also others, smoking is banned at many places and smokers are forced to go special smoking lounge when they have a smoke. This case is applied to the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have three reasons to support my opinion.

 The first is that the smells of tobacco disorder our taste. We use our taste and smell for enjoy eating. For example, if you feel dreadful smell when eat your favorite food, you ought to lose your appetite. The smell of tobaccos is nothing but stink for nonsmokers.

 The second reason is that smokers make flow of customers bad. Most people get out of the restaurant straight after their meal, but smokers begin to take a whiff after that. Smokers have confined space to smoke, so they try to enjoy smoking when they can.

 The Third reason is that it is hard to endure smoke for employee who is nonsmoker. Even if they hate smoker, since they are employee, they must service.  

 It goes without saying that restaurant is where we enjoy eating or drinking. There are not places for smoking. If you want to have a smoke you should go smoking areas.
