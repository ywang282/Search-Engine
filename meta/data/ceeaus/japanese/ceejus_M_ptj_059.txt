Is it important for college student to do part time job? Thatfs a difficult question. I thought of it for 30 minutes, but I canft make the answer of it. What should I do?
 OK, letfs consider it, assuming that I begin to do part time job. There are some merits and demerit. Now I try listing them.

Merit       1, I can earn some money. 
            2, Ifll have valuable experience there. 
            3, I can make new friends there. 

Demerit    1, Ifll be tired and cost much time. 

Wow, demerit is only one! Is this a great victory of gagreementhc? 
 No, itfs too early to determine conclusion. Majorities are not always correct. Letfs consider them.
 About merit 1 and merit 3, I donft need more money or friends now. In fact, they are important, but we donft need them infinitely. 
 About demerit 1, this is a fatal demerit. It became a barrier for me to study hard! I became a university student to study, so I donft want to do part time job very much. Wow, is this a victory of gobjectionh!?

 cOh. I remember very very important thing. The first question is not gIs it important for me?h I donft want to do part time job, but that cannot be the answer of the question. I must think from many studentsf point of view.
 Wellc.would they rather want to study than do part time job? This is an easy question. The answer will be gNoh. And some who is poor need money.

 Now I get the answer of the first question. It is gDoing part time job is important for college students.h
 You may say gWhich they want to do canft become the answer,h but I thin college students are not children, so their wills are very important.
