I agree with this statement. In Japan, today, more and more people
become to have their interest in health problem. Many smokers try to
stop smoking and the number of smokers becomes smaller than it used to.
Needless to say, smoking is not good for our health. And what is worse,
it is said that cigarette is more harmful to non|smoking people than
smokers. Because of these reasons, many restaurants in Japan make
non|smoking seats and some of them already prohibit smoking completely.
Of course, there are some opinions that it isnft necessary to prohibit
smoking completely. They also insist that smokers donft smoke in
non|smoking places, so they donft annoy other people.
But, when non|smoking seats are full and if the guest hates smoking,
there are some troubles. He has to wait until one of the seats becomes
empty or put up with smoke and has meals uncomfortably. This situation
is common and many people may have such uncomfortable experiences. To
avoid this problem, smoking should be completely prohibited in
restaurants. When smokers want to smoke, they should go outside and
smoke so that everyone has delicious meals and spends comfortable time
in restaurants.
