"I agree with this statement. We college students should have a part-time job. 
One reason is that we need much money. If we belong to some club, we often hold a banquet. And we sometimes go shopping and take a trip with club members or friends. We spend much money on many things. If we donÅft have enough money, we canÅft enjoy a precious campus life. We can only enjoy it once.
Another reason is that we have to experience many jobs. We will get some job in the future. For this, we have to experience many jobs and know how working is and how we communicate with fellow workers and seniors. Unless we donÅft gain enough experience, we may fail to some job and not communicate with people well and lose some job. We are already eighteen, nineteen or twenty.
We are not children. We are adults. We should not depend on our parents. We have to live our own lives in the future. So, we have to become real adults.
However, there are some problems. Firstly, we should not have too many part time jobs. These may make us tired and we may not study. Secondly, we have to select a right job. We should not have a part-time job which we fit with. If we know these problems, we can enjoy a part-time job.
