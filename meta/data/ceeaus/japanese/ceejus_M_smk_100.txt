I think that smoking should be prohibited at the entire restaurant.

There are many smokers in Japan. They are able to smoke at a restaurant for 
instance.

Some restaurants donft separate smokerfs tables from nonsmokerfs table. 
When nonsmokers drop into the restaurant, they must choose enduring smoke of 
cigarette or stopping entering. When they choose enduring smoke of cigarette 
and smoke spread in the room, they must become bad feelings.

At most of restaurants, smokerfs tables are separated from nonsmokerfs 
tables because smoking makes not only smokerfs health but also nonsmokerfs 
health bad condition. However nonsmokers can not help breathing smoke of 
cigarette in the restaurant where smoker smoke even if they are separated.

Health of smokers gets wrong day by day if they go on smoking. And then 
breathing smoke of cigarette is worse effect to their health than smoking. 
In short, both smoking and breathing smoke of cigarette are unhealthy 
behaviors very much and they one of main causes of cancer of the lungs. 
Smoke of cigarette also makes their taste bad.

Furthermore wallpapers of the restaurant become dirty by smoking and ash of 
cigarette makes unclean surroundings.

Those are the reason I insist that smoking should be prohibited at the 
entire restaurant.
