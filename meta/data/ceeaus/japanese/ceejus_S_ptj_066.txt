"I agree with this idea. Before you start to work, you can get some
roles as a member of society by having a part-time job. For example, if
you work at a restaurant as a hall staff, you have to communicate with
others who are various from baby to elderly people.
By repeating it, you would be good at talk to other people. It is a
great benefit and would be one of your advantages. You would be able to
get along with your bosses in your office. When you think part-time job
in that way, the experience of it will be your forever treasure. At the
same time, you do not have to depend on your parents in terms of money
by making money in yourself. However to make money in yourself does not
lead to get independent of your parents. You should rely on them in some
respects. For example when a trouble you can not deal with happens, you
will ask them for help. College students depend on parents in many
respects, but you should manage to deal with many problems little by
little. Once you are twenty years old, you have to depend on yourself.
So you should get ready for your independence from now. The first step
is part-time job as I state it that way.
