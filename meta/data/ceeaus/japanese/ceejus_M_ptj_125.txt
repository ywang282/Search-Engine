"I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because I have many reasons about that. 

The first reason is that we college students will be able to experience social life and will be able to acquire social career. When we get a job and begin to work, the experience of part-time jobs will help us in many situations. For example, some people who belong to shops in a part-time job are able to use ÅgreziÅh, some who belong to restaurants in a part-time job are able to cook or know the importance of washing hands.

The second reason is that we can get money. Before starting a part-time job, many students have never gotten such a lot of money. So we can learn how to use a lot of money. I think that most of college student have a part-time job especially to get money.

The third reason is that we can make many friends in the place of part-time jobs. Many friends senior to us or junior to us give us a lot of knowledge and information and sensation. They may cause development to us.

There are some other reasons. I think that we college student had better not study only in the college. A part-time job is the good place we can learn the life.
