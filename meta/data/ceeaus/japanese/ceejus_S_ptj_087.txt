"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

There are two reasons to agree with this idea. One is that part-time job is good experiences for college students. Second is that money is important to do what college students want to do.

 Firstly, I will explain why part-time job is good experiences for college students. They can learn many things by having a part-time job. For example, I work as a tutor. I  learn how important it is to communicate with others, to greet each other, how hard it is to teach something and to get money. I think that what I learn from a part-time job is very useful in my life. If college students don't have a part-time job, they can't realize how hard it is to work, until they have real job. Therefore they worry about their jobs and they might quit their jobs.

 Secondly, I will explain why money is important to do what college students want to do.

In this world, we need money to do something. By the way, how can college students get money, if they don't have a part-time job? Maybe, their families give them money, but they are not children yet, so they should get money to do something by themselves. For example, I want to enter a graduate school, so I need much money to enter. Therefore I have a part-time job and work very hard to save money.

 That's why I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
