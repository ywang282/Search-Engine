"I agree with this statement. Because I think it is important for college students to study society through a part-time job. For example, there are two persons. They have equal ability, but one had never worked, and the other had worked when they were college students. If you employed one of them in your company, which would you choose? Many people would choose a person who had worked. Work is more difficult than those who had never worked expected. For example relation to workers together, stress by being criticized and so on. So it is necessary for college students to have experiences of work before they graduate from college. Moreover they should know how difficult is it to earn money. When they work, and are given salary at the first time, they will very happy. At the same time they will notice how hard it to work for money is. Therefore they thank their parents for working to raise them, and come to respect them. Of course, it is to study that the most important thing for college students is. However, these experiences are also important for them. They canÅft get these experiences in classes of college. So I think it is important for them to have a part-time job.
