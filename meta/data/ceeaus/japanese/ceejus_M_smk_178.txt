I have a friend who usually smokes. But I dislike smoking. Some like smoking, others donft@like it. Smoking affects health, but many people have smoked for long time. Now in Japan smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. Generally, restaurant is where people eat food. People who donft smoke should not allowed smoking at that place. I hared that after eating or drinking smoking is best. So for people who like smoking that place is best place, but for people who donft like smoking that place is worst place, because while they eat nice foods, they must smell smoking which they donft like. Even if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants I n Japan, everyone doesnft have a trouble. People who like smoking only endure smoking. If they donft endure, they only go out of restaurant in order to smoking. Smoking banned happens things have merits and demerits. But merits clearly are larger than demerits. Then why government donft ban smoking at all the restaurants. People may donft react that. However I heard that smoking areas are gradually decreasing. Perhaps in near future smoking may be banned at all place, and smoking may be lost, and people may be can live a long life.
