"I agree that college students have part-time job.
It is because their parents pay much money for them to college. So college students work themselves and if they want to buy something, they should buy it themselves. They do so; they can start to independent from their parents.
After they graduate college, they must work. So I think that they should feel severity of working.
Someone who disagree that college students have part-time job say that studying is more important than having part-time job, but I do not think so. It is sure that studying is very important.Å@But having part-time job is also very important.Å@For example it teaches them importance of money. Importance of money can not be taught them in school. 
If college student wants to have part-time job, I never stop. But if he or she stops studying because of fatigue of part-time job, I advise him or her to retire from this job. It is because it is not enough human to live in society that he or she can only work.
I think that studying is the most important job for college students. And I think that having part-time job is also important thing for college students.
