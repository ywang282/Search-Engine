I agree with this opnion. There are three reasons.

Firstly, college students can answer for behavior through they have a part-time job. I have worked on the chainese restaurant, I had to keep my uniform and body -especially hands- clearn to serve guest food. And I had to keep smile to take a good service. If I take a mistake, I will trouble with other staffs. So, they become to answer for their behaviors.

Secondly, college students can learn from society through they have a part-time job. I have a job which is for short term. Before, I have worked on the office of advertisement. At the office, I tidied up accounts, copied advertisement, and inputed names and adresses. Then, I surely join a little in society.

Finaly, college students can earn through they have a part-time job. Almost all of college students doesn't have a lot of money. But, they think "We play moreÅI" So, a part time job realize thier dreams.

So, I think it is very important that college students have a part-time job. Surely, that will be very important experience.
