 I agree with this statement. I think college student should have a part-time job. Then, I want to express why I agree.
 First, college students need a lot of money, because they have many things to do. For example, to live alone far from family, to study abroad, to take part in a club and so on. In addition, they also spend much money on only learning in college. In order not to depend too much on their parents, they should have a part-time job and get some money. 
 Second, by having a part-time job, they will be able to get not only money but also important things. They will be able to make new human relationships and get some new skills. Those things will surely help them when they are in trouble.
 Finally, if now they can learn how to work and how to earn money, they will be able to work smoothly when they get a job. Almost all of college students will start some job after graduate college, but some of them will fail in something and worry about the failure. But if they had experienced similar situations before, they will be sure to get through the difficulty. To have a part-time job is very useful for them.
 Since, I think, to have a part-time job is very important for college student. Actually I have a part-time job now, and I get some money and learn many things. I want to make good use of what I learn from a part-time job.
