 I hate smoking very much, so I really agree with the opinion.
 First, the reason I hate smoking is that tobacco do many harms and has bad influences on human body. It hasnÅft any merits, and I can find many demerits. Throat particularly tends to be hurt by it. It has very high probability to cause cancer, and some of the heavy smokers killed by it. 
 Second, if smokers sit in the restaurant, the surrounding people also suffer from their tobacco smokes. In other words, tobacco has bad influences not only on smokers but also on the surrounding people. If there are children in the place, their brains are not developed in particular.
 Third, some people say that smoking people is very cool, but in my opinion, it isnÅft cool at all. It is rather dirty, nasty, and badly smells than cool. Though a smoking scene is broadcasted on the TV commercial, people working at the company is very foolish. If someone smokes a lot, their teeth will look like black, brown, or yellow. Their breath will smell bad. As a result, they will be hated by their surrounding people and lose their friends.
 Anyway, I hate smoking very much from all the point of view, so I really agree with the opinion that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
