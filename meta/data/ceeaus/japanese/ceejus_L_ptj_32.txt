"I agree with this statement. Because I think that I did grow up through my part-time job. My part-time job is to contact with other people. So I must explain the content of the contact to many people very clearly, shortly and briefly. And it is out of the question to say non-collect things. For the first time, I found the importance and responsibility to what I say. And I also learned the difficulty of making myself understood, and I always need to think if what I try to explain to others is what they want to know truly. Or I have to reform what I want to say to what ordinary people understand easily and comprehend otherÅfs saying exactly. Unless I cannot, they donÅft get good explains they want, so they donÅft think they want to contact with me. Of course, at first, I could not do it perfectly, but now I can (sometimes others and I also cannot understand what I sayÅc). Thus, I believe that I learned many things from my part-time job, and my work-teamÅfs other staffs who help, advise and teach me. These experiences will help me in the future when I actually work as an office worker. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But needless to say that it is not good to consider doing part-time job is much more important than study!
