I agree with this opinion. There are several reasons for this.
One is that we need to know about our society. I haven`t worked as a part-time job, so I don`t know about the system of salary. In many senses, we need to get familiar to working as the one of ÅgSHAKAI-JIN,Åh the ordinary workers.
 Another is that the important things for college student is not only studying but playing, living by ourselves, and working. We get many things by working. For example, if we work in a restaurant, we learn the difficulties as a server, the tiredness to deal with ill-mannered consumer, and the skill to cook. If you work as a teacher of a prep school, we learn how to teach something to students well, and make ourselves smart. And finally we know the difficulties in our high schools! If we work as an instructor of a sport gym, we can improve our power, body balance, and the skill of communication.
The other is that we can improve our skill of communication by working as part-time job. A part-time job is more flexible than a fixed job because we can`t choose the job. In this point, a part-time job is more convenient than a fixed job.
 That`s why I think that it`s important for college student to have a part-time job.
