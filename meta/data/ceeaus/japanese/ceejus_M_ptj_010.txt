I think that the part-time job plays the important part of college studentsÅf lives, so it is necessary for them. IÅfll write why I think so
.
Firstly, students can know the system of the society that they live in through the job. Nowadays, it becomes the social problem that a lot of people give up their jobs in few years. Of course, the reasons why they gave up their jobs are valuables, but there could be some people who are not able to be used to working. Though working is the one of the obligations of Japanese, those who got used to living the rich lives without working are tend not to continue their jobs. If they could know the mean of working through the part-time job, they would continue their jobs.

Secondly, the part-time jobs give students a kind of confidence because they are given their own part, whatever they are big or small, in their workplaces. It is like club or circleÅfs activity, but the part-time job is unique at the point that those who are various age or social standpoint need them.

That is why I think that the part-time job is necessary for the college students. Of course, some people say that it is ridiculous for students to work for little money neglecting their duty ÅeÅfstudyingÅfÅf. However, I think college students do various things that they can do only in this time.
