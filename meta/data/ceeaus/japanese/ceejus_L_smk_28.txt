Cigarettes have bad smell. Because of it, someone who hates it feel bad.

In that situation, they can not have meals with joy, happiness and so on. 

And cigarettes do more harm than good. Their smokes ruin not only smokers' health but also nonsmokers'.

Then, what can we do for this problem? Should we ban those who smoke in restaurant?

I do not think so. Smoking should not be completely banned.

I think that those who smoke and don't smoke have to be separated. They have to be placed different place. They have to have meals in different place.

The reason why I have such an opinion is the following.

Those who smoke have a right of smoking, in the same way, those who do not smoke have a right to avoid smoking. Their rights are to be protected at the same time.

To achieve it, we have to separate them.

The managers of restaurants have to make seats for smoker and nonsmoker. This is one of the ways to achieve it.

 The core of my opinion is their coexisting. Smoking is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is allowed. I just restrict it for their coexisting. I choose not eliminating but coexisting.
