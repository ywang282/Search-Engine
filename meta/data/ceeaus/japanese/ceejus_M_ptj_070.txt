 I agree with the opinion with two reasons.
 First, college students get a member of society after several years. If they donÅft know rules or manners in society or working place, they must mistake in lots of cases. They canÅft excuse about mere basic mistakes because they are a member of society, not a part time job or something. If they have learned rules or manners in society because of part time job, they must mistake in only few cases. They may mistake, but they may less mistake because they know more knowledge in society than the other group.
 Second, college students are classified as adults, not as children. Children should depend their lives on parents, but adults should not depend their lives on others. Of course, it is difficult to classify them, so some says they are not adults. But they are not Children, too. They should not depend their lives on others perfectly. So they should earn a part of the cost of living as the step to a member of society.
 Some says college is a studying place, not working place. But I think college students should learn not only mathematics or English, but also rules or manner in society.
