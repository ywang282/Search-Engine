"I think that college students should have a part-time job once. We are going to have a good experience for their future by having a part-time job. Part-time job is a good experience for to become a member of society. We can experience social responsibility and strict in advance by having a part-time job. These experience is good effects our future. And, because school days, we can have a many experience. If there are interesting, we should do it. Even if there are not interesting, we should have a part-time job to find sense. But, we become students to study. We should study. If we take all the time in school days to part-time job, we could not study enough and it is bad effects for our future. It is wrong that you have a part-time job without study and only study without have enough experience. We should have a part-time job and we also should study. So we should use time efficiently to study and have a good experience. Using time efficiently is also necessary to become a member of society.

So I think that college students should have a part-time job.
