Of course we know that restaurants is the place where we enjoy having
lunch or dinner. There are no people who eat with smoking. If we have
lunch or dinner with smoking, we feel like tasting bad. Maybe we donÅft
go to restaurants alone but we go there with someone. In that situation,
a person goes to restaurants with someone. If he smokes at the
restaurant, probably other people hate it. A man who smokes at
restaurants may feel good, but other people donÅft feel good, donÅft enjoy
lunch or dinner. Smoking also does harm to weaken-smoking people. If
ever a smoking place is separated from non-smoking place, a little smoke
made by at smoking place will cover non-smoking place. When the
restaurant deal with the smoke, the restaurant must install machines
which deal with smoke. The machines cost the restaurant much money. It
is not good for the restaurant. So, smoking should be completely banned
at all the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants does harm many
people, but non-smoking at the restaurants doesnÅft harm any people.
Non-smoking at the restaurants needs for us to enjoy lunch or dinner
there. It is important for us to keep manner where we have a lunch or
dinner.
