I agree with this opinion. 
The smell of the cigarette smoke is unpleasant for me because I do not smoke the cigarette. Though the smell of the cigarette might be not anxious for the smokerÅCI think that many people who doesn't smoke the cigaretteÅ@will think the smell of the cigarette is unpleasant.
 
The restaurant is a place where people eat meal. PeopleÅ@should  come to the restaurant the atmosphere there and  to enjoy the smell and the taste of the meal.
The smell of the cigarette might remarkably ruin them.
Though there are a lot of restaurants where the smoking seat and the no-smoking zone are divided, there are some problems. The space has not divided completely.
Even if in a no-smoking zone near the smoking seat, I feel the smell of the cigarette.
It is often when it is necessary to sit on the smoking seat because the no-smoking zone is overcapacity. Namely, it is imperfect in measures of dividing the seat. 
I think that it is painful for the smoker not to be able to smoke the cigarette. It is a problem to limit smoking too much severely. However, it might be not too painful to endure the cigarette while it eats in the restaurant.
 
Thus,I think that it is the most desirable that the restaurant stops smoking all seats.
