Å@I agree with this idea, because I think that smoking is an annoying
act in a public space. Smoke of cigarettes smells stinky. Whether
smokers notice about that or not, non smokers bother its scent. It is
really unhappy to eat in stinky smoke which smokers make, and at the
same time the scent sticks with our hair and clothes strongly. We canÅft
get free from it, until we wash up all. That really annoys us.

Everyone knows that smoking is not good for health. People have poor
circulation of blood by smoking, and it causes a lot of diseases like an
irregular pulse, a cancer of lung and so on. Even more trouble thing is
that it can harm not only a person who smokes, but also many people who
are around him or her. It effects badly to especially children who only
have organs which not completely developed and we have to care about
those delicate children.

The idea of this makes a comfortable life for non smokers and it makes a
healthy life for smokers. To considerate these bad and good aspects of
smoking in a public space, the government of Japan should prohibit it at
all restaurants in Japan.
