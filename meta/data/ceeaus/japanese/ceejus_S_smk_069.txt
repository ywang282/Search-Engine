I agree with this statement. When we go to the restaurants, the food menu often shows some information such as the foodÅfs calorie and amount of salt, to care about our health, but there are some smoking seats and sometime all the tables have ashtrays. I think this condition is no good.
It is a bad manner to smoke while we are at table, and I have heard that as a sensible customer, not smoking at table is one of the international rules and smoking should be done only in smoking room. If someone smokes in restaurant, other customers who donÅft smoke canÅft taste the dishes very well, because breathing smoke makes their taste get dull. IÅfm not a smoker and so are my parents, so when someone begins smoking next to my table, we feel bad. This environment is bad for children, too. It is unfair for the customers who are not smokers to put up with tobacco smoke.
If we think of all the customersÅf health including smokers, not smokers, and children, we need not smoking seats anymore. Smokers should go outside when they smoke and try not to have troubles to others so that all of the customers in the restaurant can have a good time.
