I think that the part-time job is important for college students. Actually, I am working part-time now. For, to the first, I want to earn money for the club activity. Differing from the high school student, the club activity becomes real at the university. Additionally, the scale of the club activity is large, and there are a lot of people in the circle. The large scale costs money for club activity. And money is necessary to play with them. But, I do not think that it wants parents to pay for that money. I am unpleasant in parents' paying for money that is needed for me to do what I want to do. And secondarily, there is reason that I want to buy what I want to. Differing from high school student, the price of the thing that I want is high when becoming a university student. But I do not think that I want my parents to pay for money of these things, too. And I want to save up money and to buy my wanting things for myself.
Certainly, there is an opinion that you should study hard without working when you are student. And you borrow money from parents now, and when starting your adult life, it only has to return. But I think that there is something of experience that can be done only by this age now. After I have found employment once, I think that it is not possible to work part-time at all. It is bad that the part-time job becomes a main theme at the student life. But I think the part-time job is necessary if it becomes a method of obtaining money that is needed to do what I want to.
