"I agree with this opinion. This is because that I think people 
can learn a lot of things that they cannot learn just at the university 
if they have a part-time job. There are many kinds of things that they 
can learn at the university, but I think there are also many another 
kinds of things that they cannot learn there.
       Now I donÅft have a part-time job, but I want to do some. The 
reason why is not only to earn some money by myself, but also to be 
helpful for someone. I believe that the experience of having a 
part-time job will enrich the peopleÅfs life later. To have some 
part-time job, they meet many people in various situations, so they can 
have a chance to communicate with people in another generation and 
touch various way of thinking and living of the people. I think they 
also can get some information of how to live well in the world through 
working some part-time job.
       In other words, to have a part-time job is a kind of preparation 
for their future, I think. Therefore, I agree with the opinion that it 
is important for college students to have a part-time job.
