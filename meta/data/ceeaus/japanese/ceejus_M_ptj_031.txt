I agree this statement. Because I think it is important for college students to make money and to experience a part time job. In fact, I have a part-time job at restaurant in Osaka. As my home is too far from Kobe University to go to school, I live in Kobe alone. So, I need a lot of money to live. And I belong to a club, so I need some money for it. And now I have a lot of time, so I want to different places and but many clothes, and get the license to drive a car. But thanks to the part-time job, I have money enough to live. IÅfm given some money by my parents, but the money isnÅft enough to live, and I donÅft depend on my parents very much.     

     Then, thanks to a part-time job we can many things. For example, thanks to the part-time job I was able to learn how to communicate with visitors and to cook. Then I made friends there, and they donÅft go to college or go to an expert school or work the restaurant as an employee. They are very different from me in the meaning of these, so I was able to learn many things I donÅft have from them. I think in university I canÅft   learn these things, so this experience was very worth for me. 

     So, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
