I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the 

restaurants in Japan.

 I have two reasons to the opinion.

 First, smoking in the public space is too danger.

 Because, a cigarette brings us bad effect.

 My boyfriend has a asthma. When he absorbs much cigarette 

smoke, he can has a spasm. In the worst case, he can die. I 

think that you should know a existence of such a person. Smoking

is a very danger for such a person.

 To be sure, some people want to smoke after dinner. But, it is a

matter of life and death for other people. I want some people who want to

smoke after dinner to go to a smoking space or go out and smoke.

 And, a cigarette injures all of us. ItÅfs not so good to the public.

 Second, it has bad smell.

 My mother is smoker. But she always says when we go to a restaurant,

ÅgOur dishes become a bad taste because of a smoking smell.Åh Even smoker

donÅft like a smoking smell ! Of cause, I also dislike the smell. Restaurant

is a eating space. Not smoking space.

 ThatÅfs way I consider that smoking at the restaurants is bad. And, it should

be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
