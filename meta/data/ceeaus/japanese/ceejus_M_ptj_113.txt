"I agree with having a part-time job. Because working is precious experience and the thing that we should have responsibility for. So we can get much useful time in it. But I disagree with having it only for getting money. Because we should study in free time. So we should work to study. For example, if one wants to be a teacher, he should work at a juku to learn to teach children useful knowledge. And if one wants to be a sports trainer, he should work at gym to study useful knowledge about sports, health, and so on and to learn communicate with many people. In the other words, it is important for us to work at the place where there is the thing that we are interested in. So it is stupid thing to have a part-time job only for getting money. And when we work only for money, we waste so much time. We should have it in our minds that we have limited time. It has only four years. But if we use it usefully, four years is long, long time. So I agree with having a part-time job only if we have it for studying many precious things.
