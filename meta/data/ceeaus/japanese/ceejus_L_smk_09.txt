Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in japan.
Because smoking is bad for our health.
First tabacco contain highly poisonous nicotine, volatile and liquid alkaloid, so people who smoke heavily tend to have lung cancer or get cancer in their throat.
Besides passive smoking is also harmful foer us.
Cigarette smoke contain a cancer-causing agent, the smoke go out our body is more poisonous than that go in ours.
It's very stupid!
Smoking have a bad influence on all the people being around very much. 
Lastly, cigarette smoke smell bad, so smoking should be prohibit at the table.
That's why I agree with this argument.
