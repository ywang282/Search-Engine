I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have two reasons.
 The first reason is that I think smoker may have less opportunity to smoke in a day. Smoking is bad to humanÅfs health if smokers smoke too much. The probability of getting lung cancer will be increase. In addition, too much smoking stain teeth. 
 They will smoke too much in a restaurant because they can relax there. So, if only not to smoke in a restaurant, the number of cigarettes which they smoke will be decrease. 
 The second reason is that smoking affect not only smokersÅf health but also othersÅf health. If they have a lunch or dinner with their friend at a restaurant and smoke a cigarette, he or she breathes the smoke of cigarettes. Then, it is possible that the smoke affect their friendsÅf health. Beside, if he or she hates the smell of the smoke, he or she will be displeased at the smoke. He or she can not enjoy having a lunch or dinner and talking. 
 Then, if they smoke at a restaurant, the smoke will affect also people who are at the near table. 
 So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.
