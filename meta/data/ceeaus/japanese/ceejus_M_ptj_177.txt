"I agree with this statement. There are three reasons why I think it is important.

 First of all, through a part time job we can experience and learn many things which we can not in our school life. When we graduate the college and get a job, the experiences is very important.

 Second, we can really learn the importance of money. Almost all of us have lived using money which our parents had earned. We might take it granted that we have money and can use it. We know getting money is very difficult. However we donÅft know how difficult it is in real sense. We can not learn the difficulty until we have a part time job. When we experience the difficulty, we know the importance of money for the first time, and we begin to thank our parents.

 Third, college students have many free times. Of course studying is the most important section of students. However, I realized the fact; even if, we study very hard, we have more free times than when we were high school students. Now, I donÅft have any part time jobs. When the classes are end, I donÅft have what to do, and go karaoke, boring or so on. As the result money disappears from my wallet. If I have a part time job, I get money and I donÅft have any times to use money. It is just like killing two birds with one stone.
