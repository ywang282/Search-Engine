 I  agree  this  opinion; It  is  important  for  students  to  have  a  
part-time  job.  There  are  three  reasons.
        First,  by  working  by  ourselves,  we  can  learn  the  value  of  money  and  we  become  use  money  more  carefully.  In  fact,  I  have  thought  that  money  is  more  valuable  and  thanked  my  parents  for  giving  me  money  since  I  had  a  part-time  job.
        Second,  we  can  learn  to  fit  into  society.  For  example,  how  to  use  a  right  term  of  respect  for  the  person,  ability  of  communication,  and  so  on.  We  cannot  live  in  society  without  these  things.  However,  we  cannot  learn  these  things  by  studying  in  college.
        Finally,  it  is  useful  for  us  to  have  a  variety  of  part-time  jobs  when  we  select  our  occupations.  For  example,  I  had  a  part-time  job  of  checking  answer  and  teaching  in  a  clam  school  when  I  was  a  high  school  student.  It  is  very  boring  for  me  because  I  had  to  only  sit  for  a  long  time.  In  addition  to,  sometimes  my  words  are  not  understood  by  students  in  clam  school.  So,  I  knew  I  do  not  suit  the  occupation  as  a  teacher.
        Therefore,  I  think  that  it  is  important  for  students  to  have  a  part-time  job.
