"I also think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

There are two reasons I think so.

First of all, they are able to learn the difficulty of working as a member of society.

There are a lot of kinds of people in office, and they have to get along well with their colleague even if they were people that they dislike.

For example, in university, they do not have to have the relation with people that they do not like.

However, in office, they have to have good relation with people they do not like.

Through part-time job, they learn the difficulty and the importance of getting along well with people.

Moreover, they experience a lot of things that will be useful in the future.

Second, they clearly learn the importance of money.

To do a part-time job is so hard that they sharply learn the value of money that they get by working.

The experience of doing a part-time job tells them the importance of money.

In addition, they appreciate their parents who grow them up.

WhatÅfs more, the experience develops their ability of various fields.

For these two reasons, I agree with him that college students should do a part-time job.
