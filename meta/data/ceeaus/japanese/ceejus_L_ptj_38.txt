I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.

First, we need to get some enough money to live.

In my case, I have to pay costs of rent and school expenses by

myself. So, I need to get a scholarship and work for going to the

college. If you donÅft enough to earn your rent and school expenses,

you must need some money. When you want to go abroad and get

a driving license, for example, you have to get large money. You 

must have a part-time job to wish your hope.

 Second, part-time job is useful for your future.

 I have two part-time job. One of my job is a restaurantÅfs staff, the 

other is a teacher. Managers of both are good friend of mine. So, they 

teach me about the management, a social situation, their experience 

and so on. There is a lot of learning from their talk. In addition, to

have a part-time job is to become a working member of society. So,

when we think about our future, the experience of part-time job is 

useful. Moreover, we can learn some social common sense.

 That is why I think having a part-time job is important for college student.
