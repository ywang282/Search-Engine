 If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, I must be very happy.  It is because I donft like smokes of cigarettes. At restaurants, I would like to enjoy delicious dishes, but smokes of cigarettes interrupt it. The smokes have very strong smell, so, I canft smell dishesf good flavor.

 As another reason, most of Japanese know what smoking is very bad for our health. Smokes of cigarettes are consisted by many bad facts, for instance, nicotine, and CO2. Brain and some organs are damaged by these bad facts. And younger people are damaged more badly. Especially for children, smokes of cigarettes are big problem for their body. But they canft escape from it easily.

 Now, there are many smokers in Japan, and I know it. But I really want smoking to be completely banned at restaurant in Japan. It is must be good for not only non-smokers but also heavy smokers. I think that almost of smokers drink alcohol when they eat dishes at restaurants. But I have heard that drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes is very bad pair. It makes their health bad gravely. 

 I think that this idea should be expanded all over the world, not only in Japan. And I hope that many non-smoker and smoker enjoy delicious dishes at restaurants together.
