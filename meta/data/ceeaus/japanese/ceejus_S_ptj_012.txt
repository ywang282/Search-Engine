I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. 

There are two reasons.

First, we can learn importance of money and difficulty of earning money.

When I was high school student, having a part time job was banned. And I think that many of high schools are same. So, I have not had a part time job. Recently I started a

part time job at a Chinese noodle restaurant , I must do a lot of things. Cooking Chinese noodles, Chinese fired rice, Gyoza, fried chicken, washing dishes, and calling for orders.

My part time job is very hard, but I think that all part time jobs are hard. I found difficulty to learn money, and now I found importance of money. 

Second, we can earn money by having a part time job. We became college student and we have free time longer than when we were junior high school student. So we need more money. For example, playing with friends, traveling, club activities. By having a part time job, we can earn money for such things. And we can make our campus life more massive .

So I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
