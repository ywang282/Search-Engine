"I agree with this statement.
In my opinion, college students have many free time and many chances to play and drink with their friends or company of club activity. I donÅft think that their parents need to give them money for their playing because college students are old enough to earn money for their playing. Furthermore, school fees are high, and if one lives alone for going to school, it also needs a lot of money. They go to the university with their own will. So they should use their free time to get money for themselves.
 Then, the age when one goes to the university is the time when one grows up greatly, so it is important for one to experience many various things. Through the part-time job, students can learn the difficulty of earning money, the worth of money, human relations, and more; they have many things to learn only in youth. Having such experience before employment is probably helpful for themselves, I think.
  And they can make friends at the shop where they work part-time. It may be interesting and instructive to have friends of other university or different generation. More friends they have, more interesting their life become, maybe.
 This is why I agree with college studentsÅf part-time job.
