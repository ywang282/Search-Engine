I agree with this opinion. Tobacco is worse than useless.
Tobacco have two bad reasons.
Firstly, smoke is an unpleasant smell to nonsmokers.
Especially, nonsmokers are displeased with smoke when they
eat.
Before, I and my mother ate at one of restaurant. This
restaurant was very fassionable itarian restaurant. But,
this restaurant didn
Åft have no smoking seat. We were suffocated by smoke when
we ate pasta.
 Each foods have smell. People feel foods have good smell.
But, smoke is very bad smell. Smoke make nonsmokers lose
their appetite. So, smoke not only make nonsmokers
displease and cling to cloths and body but also make
nonsmokers lose their appetite.
Secoundly, smoke is very poisonous. From recent studies,
smoke do not only smorkers but also nonsmoker who stay
near by smoker. On the countrary, nonsmoker who stay near
by smoker rathar than smoker was risked their own life.
Commonly, people know that smokers get cancer
&#8211;especially lung cancer
Å| easier than nonsmokers. But smoke  damaged even people
who stay near by smoker. 
 I think that smoke is free. So, I pity that smoker is
limitted place of smoke. But,  smoker can damage other
differ from smoker can smoke freely. They should not
trouble for other.
