" I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.I think there are two reasons for this opinion.First,all college students need money.Some studnts earn it to save money,some need it to live themselves,and so on.I think it is very important for men to save money because they need money when they get married and it is generally man that pay wedding money in Japan.And college sudents have to go school with their own clothes.I think almost students wore a school uniform when they are high school student,so they wore same clothes every day,that is a school uniform,and they must not be troubled with clothes.But now they have to wear different clothes every day,ofcource some people may same clothes,so they earn money to buy clothes.People who belong a club need it to buy the club goods.College books are high cost,so we need money to buy it.
> Second,we can learn social rules and common sence to have a part-time job.This is a thing that we canft learn through college.I think all people should experience part-time job at least one,so I want to have it early because I have never experienced it.
> These are my opinions.
