"I agree with the statement.

First, I think if we donÅft have a part-time job, we can hardly understand the value of money, and the difficulty of getting money. Some parents would tell their children how hard it is to earn money. But others would not. My mother worked as a doctor in China, my native country, but now she works as a part-timer at a chocolate factory. 15 Years ago my father came to Japan to work as an engineer and 13 years ago my mother and I came to Japan. At that time my mother quitted her job, because in Japan she canÅft use her doctor license. In chocolate factory she sometimes has to carry some heavy boxes and keeps standing. She sometimes told me how hard it is to get money. And I thought I have completely understood the value of money. But after my sixteenÅfs winter vacation, I first had a part-time job, I knew I hadnÅft understand the difficulty of getting money completely. I think only after having the experience of working that we can really understand the value of money. And we are old enough to understand it.

Second, in college we can learn a lot of things, but we canÅft learn how to work. I think it would be hard for us to adapt ourselves to society after our graduation from college without any experience of working in society. So we should have a part-time job during our school days and make some experiences. And I think part-time jobs would also enable us to know the society system around us.

These are the reasons that I agree with the opinion.
