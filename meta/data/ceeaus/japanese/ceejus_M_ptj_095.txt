"I think that it is vary important for college students to have a part-time job.  One of the reason is that college students spare a lot of money to buy some clothes and to play with friends and to do what you want to do.  In particular, in the case of a student who lives alone, he also must pay bill of meal,electricity and so on.  College students have to get much money.
 Another reason is that the experience that you did a part-time job will be useful when you get an official job, and you can be used to doing a job and have a confidence about work. So, you will be able to work efficiently. In addition, if you have a part-time job, you have something to do with more and more people and you learn how to touch each other and you will make friends.
