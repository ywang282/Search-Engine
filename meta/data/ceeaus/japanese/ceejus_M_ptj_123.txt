"I agree with the statement. I have two reasons. First, I think they can
learn a part of society. Of course, they canft learn it completely. But,
it is important to know society.
When they graduate university, without knowing it, they will confuse.
They may make mistakes from it. Second, they can get some skills. For
example, skill of communication,expert or general knowledge. Perhaps,
the knowledge which they get to have a part time job are influenced
their future. Especially, I think skill of communication is very
important. Of course, there is difference of skill of it. But, in our
life, we canft live without communication. It is base of life. And, it
is sure that the person who has high ability of it is liked. I tell you
two reasons I agree with this statement until now. But, I want to except
a case. We are university students. We passed the hard entrance
examination to study something. If they can not study because of part
time job, I donft agree this statement. Part time job is said garbeith
by Japanese. I think this word garbeith come from German. The word is
garbeitenh. This word means gworkh in English. But, when students use
this word, it means gstudyh in English. So, the work of students are
studying. We enter this university to study. From this reason, I think
studying is first priority and part time job is second. Therefore, in
this case, I disagree with it."
