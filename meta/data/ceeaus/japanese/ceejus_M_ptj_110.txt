"I agree with this statement. Because having a part time job grows up college students. 

　First, we can know rules of society. For example, we can learn to keep a time, keep a promise and greet cheerfully or so. I think that these rules are very important things. .Second, we can know how difficult to get money. If we know that, we will not spend money in vain. This will be a good for us when we are independent on parents and live alone. We can also know the joy of getting money on our own. 　　

　Finally, we can meet a lot of people by having a part-time job. Communicating many people, we can grow up. This is the fact that college students who engage in several kinds of part-time jobs often can not concentrate in studying in college. But I think we should not only study in school but also learn about society out of school while we are college student. It is most important for college students to study hard. But it is also important for us to learn a rule of society.

　 This is why I agree with this statement which it is important for college students to have a part-time job unless we have it too much.
