I want to ban smoking in restaurant for family, but I donft think itfs necessary that banning smoking in restaurant which almost customers are adults ,for instance bar.
 Cigarette is harmful for people not only who smoking but also people around him/her. But it doesnft effect too much to mention for adults during short time such as meal. So I donft think it is not necessary to care too much. Of course there are many people those who donft like cigarette, so if they are at same place smoking people must care around him/her.
But for children cigarette is very harmful, and children canft care by themselves, so adults surround him/her must care of them for instants of children, especially parents and smoking people. One of the ways to keep children from harm of cigarette is banning in restaurant for family. 


 I think that important thing is not only regulations, but also morals of smoking people. If all smokers always pay attention situation around him/her, severe restricts are not needed. Due to some bad manners smokers, many smokers who smoke keeping moral involved and are restricted as much as bad smokers. I think it is more ideal smokers are restricted not by regulations, but their own good sense.
