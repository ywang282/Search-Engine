"I agree with this statement because having a part-time job will be good experience for college students. I think we can meet people who are various generations. Doing so, we can get a sense of values which we did not have till then. For example, they are manners and common sense.

I think also we can experience various jobs. Besides, we get a skill and knowledge such as cooking, carrying, register, and so on. Some restaurants or bars give meals for a person who has a part-time job there. It is grateful for college students who are particularly living themselves.

If we work and earn money ourselves, we learn the importance of money. It also becomes economical help. Besides, if there were enough money, we can spend more money on our favorite things. It changes our sense of money when we received money from our parents. The new sense of money makes us not to spend money wastefully. We can use money by our intention and responsibility.

I think it is the last chance that we have a part-time job when we are college students. We can get the ability that we live ourselves before we go into the society. It is useful when we go into the society.
