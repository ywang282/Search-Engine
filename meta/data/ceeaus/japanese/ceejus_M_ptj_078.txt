I think college students need to work in part time job for getting money and responsibility.
 When I was a high school student, working in part time job was banned by my high schools law, so, I didnÅft know how working was.
 When I become a college student, I start to work in part time job to get some money, for example, assistant in construction field, visiting teacher, street advertising staff, human sample for chemical substance, and so on Åc.
 For the first time, I think that getting money is most important than other things, but, through working in various jobs and being concerned in many people living in several social positions, I learned that duties follow labor.
 When I was lasted for meeting time for 5~10 minutes or misunderstood meeting place, I was scolded severely by chief, I was angry ,but, it is natural that the manÅfs behavior, in group works, one person was late for schedule, others of the groupÅfs members must wait the rude man.
 College students tend to be uplift personal humans, so, they (we) need to work to see many worlds and systems, to know how the working for  one of the gears of society.
