I agree with this statement. There are two reasons.
First, I think that college students should earn money to buy something
they want by themselves. 　
Indeed, their parents spend much money for their food, clothes and
lessons in college and so on. But, in fact they are enough to earn money
by themselves. So, I think they should not depend on their parents very
much. 　　　　Moreover, they are able to understand importance of money
and how difficult their parents work to earn money for them everyday
through a part-time job.
Second, experience of a part-time job shows them a lot of things.
For example, they are able to learn how to communicate with other people
such as their boss or customers. After they graduate from college, most
of them must work in society. If they didn’t experience a part-time job,
they may be at a loss when they are in trouble in their company in the
future. They are also responsible for their job and they come to think
more that they should not be late than when they go to college to attend
the class.
A part-time job is useful in living in society and makes them grow.
Therefore, I think it is important for them to have a part-time job.
