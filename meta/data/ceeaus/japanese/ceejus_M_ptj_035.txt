I agree to this topic. I think that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. It is because I think being a college student means to take a step forward into a social life as an adult. Our parents may pay our school expenses. Yet we are already old enough to earn our own allowances.
     First of all, if you have any hobbies you would like to enjoy while you are in college, I think it is your will and responsibility to continue.
     Secondly, I think the period of college life is also a training time for us to go into the actual life of workings. And so we would learn what it is like to be working for a company or a shop. I also think it is important for us to experience the hard works to earn money.
     Lastly, while we are in college, we will naturally get to the age of twenty when we are treated as an adult person by the society and become legally adult. After then we will be able to smoke, drink, and gamble and so on. But we are at the same time expected to be responsible about our life, living and thoughts. A good example for this would be the public elections we do to participate in governmental deals. And the other example is when you commit a crime your full name will be announced.
Therefore, I think that part time jobs during college life would be a good time for us to experience various things and also to learn various things we donÅft learn at school.
