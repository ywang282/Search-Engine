I agree with the statement. Of course, college students must study hard. However, I think a part-time job has some advantages. I will show you advantages.

 First of all, I think it is not good that college students completely depend on parents for money that is used by playing, because almost college students are more than 20 years old. They are adult, so they should prepare for independence. So they should try to play by only using money that they earn by a part-time job. There is advantage that college students can independent.

  Second, a part-time job makes you notice the importance of money. When I did not have a part-time job, I usually waste money on buying unimportant things. However, I have a part-time job now, I cannot waste money. When I go shopping, I think carefully the goods which I want to buy are really necessary. And I get to save money for future. There is advantage that not only you notice the importance of money but also you can find new use for money.

  Finally, you can meet many people at workplace. For example the boss, senior, company, customers and so on. When you talk the boss, you must be polite. When you talk to customers, you must answer with polite words. There is advantage that you always be able to be polite unconsciously. On the other hand, when you talk to company, you may find new of life. You may be able to find good friends who you cannot meet at college. There is advantage that you can broaden your horizons.

  So I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
