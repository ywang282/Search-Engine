Certainly, smoking is a bother for others.
But smokers pay heavy tax when they buy them and in Japan tobacco is  
legal over 20 years old, so they have smoking rights and they can  
smoke at the restaurants.

Tobacco is a one of luxuries and many smokers may want to smoke during  
or after a meal.
They often say ÅgIt is very delicious that smoking after a meal  
or drink.Åh

But non-smokers have rights of not to be exposed smoke naturally, too.

Tobacco smoke is very harmful especially for other people, and there  
are many people who don't want to be exposed to that smoke.

We just want to enjoy eating or drinking delicious meals and talking  
with friends at the restaurants.

How we can solve that simple question?

Now, there are divisions into smoking and non-smoking areas at the  
stations or universities and so on.
So it is necessary that dividing smokers from non-smokers at the  
restaurant, too.

To  dividing smokers from non-smokers completely, it may be able to  
make  a progress improving relations between smokers and non-smokers.
And we have to understand each other, smokers and non-smokers.

After appropriate measure of smoke, smokers can smoke at the  
restaurants in Japan.
