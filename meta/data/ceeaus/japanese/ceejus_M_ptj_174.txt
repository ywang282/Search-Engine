"I agree with this statement, because I think to have a part-time job is good experiences and Japanese college students have a lot of spare time. First, through working, we are able to learn a lot of things and get some skills. Sometimes we have some troubles, but we are able to solve if we try to as possible as we can. These experiences will help us in the future for example it will be good weapons in job hunting. These experiences may also help us find new interests. It is said that todayÅfs Japanese college students are not able to find things which they want to do in the future so they may find that things if they do a part-time job. Second, in Japan it is said that college students have less lessons than junior high school students and high school students and have much more vacations, so they have a lot of spare time. It is chance to do a part-time job and earn much money. Then during the vacation, they are able to go a lot of places with their friends. I think t
hat the time when people are able to do a lot of things in the life is when we are college students. Then I think that college students should experience many new things through working.
