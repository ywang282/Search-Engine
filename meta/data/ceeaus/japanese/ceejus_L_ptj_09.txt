I quite agree with student have a part-time job. The first reason that I think this is I have a part-time job. 
 I work at cram school as a teacher twice a week in Monday and Thursday evening. If you want to do, you are able to be a cram school teacher without experience. The wage of this part-time job is more efficient than the other part-time job. Besides I teach study to pupil or junior high school student, I also study that I forgot things. 
 In general terms, a student of university who lives all by him or herself is poverty. So he should work as a part-time job, otherwise he cannot use money for pastime or sports I think it is reason why many students have part-time job. 
 If you can it efficient, you should do part-time job, because I think it maybe very useful for your life and future.
 But some people may say Ågthe student should studyÅh I think it is not strange. But I think there are no people who spend all his time to study. So I recommend you try to work as part-time job instead of break. Perhaps you will be able to make a lot of friends too.
