I am opposed to forbidding smoking at all the restaurants. Incidentally,
I am not smoking.

As one of the reasons, for a smoker smoking tobacco is relaxed one.
Restaurants aim at thing that all the visitors have a meal with a
pleasant and sufficient feeling. Nevertheless, for a smoker prohibition
of smoking is only pain. Actually, you see the scene smokers enter after
smoking tobacco before going into the place where a smoker cannot smoke.
Prohibition of smoking is pain for a smoker so much. Then, it is putting
the cart before the horse. I do not regard making anything prohibition
as a clever way. Therefore, smoking is not given up in all area in a
restaurant. Those who do not smoke dislike the influence by the smoke of
tobacco. Therefore, what is necessary is just to separate the place
where smoker can be smoking and the place where they cannot be so more
than now, for instance, the smoking car of a train etc.

After all if it think actually, in Japan the consciousness to the health
impairment caused by tobacco is low. And take various problems into
consideration, it is impossible to ban smoking at all the restaurants.
Even though it can do, I will oppose it.
