"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that there are three reasons. 

At first, I think that college students should do what they want to do during school days. For example, studying abroad, traveling some countries, traveling Japanese, etc. If they do these things, they must grow up more than now. But they actually can not do these things. Because they do not have much money, they can not do these things. So they need a lot of money and must save for what they want to do. 

Second reason is to learn real societies. A lot of college students will work in offices. Then, if they do not know real societies, they can adapt themselves to real societies easily. So they need to have a part-time job. 

Third reason is to meet people of various generations. But almost all the people are not same generation with college students in real societies, they must work in offices. If they can experience to meet people of various generations during school days, they can adapt themselves to real societies. In other word, to have a part-time job is to gather experiences in real societies.
