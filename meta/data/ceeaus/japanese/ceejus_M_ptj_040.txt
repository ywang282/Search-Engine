I agree that itfs important for college students to have part time job. College students need more money and itsf life space expander than high school life before. In entrance season, many welcome parties are held on for new students. So much money is need. But many times senior students pay a lot. In campus life, friends increase more and more. Pleasure needs money in friendship. Not only amusement but also study needs much money. Many college students want to study abroad, but going foreign country is difficult for students on money. In addition, many college textbooks are expensive. And license examinationsf cost is high. Many students have and ride bike, but recently gasolinefs price is much higher. Therefore I think that college students should have part time job. Of course, studentsf duty is learning, shouldnft be absorbed in part time job.
