I donft smoke, but I think that smoking banned completely at all the restaurants in Japan is no necessity.
Instead the restaurants should be completely separated smoking area and no smoking area. One reason of them is that smoke brings more harm for people around smoker than smoker. Therefore smoker make effort to avoid disturbing people around themselves. However, smoking is private affair though smoking increase risk of some disease.
We shouldnft oppress people who like smoke as long as they obey manner.
Separate smoke area and no smoke area is the thing that canft set by visitors, restaurants places no smoking seat and smoking seat with consider the number of smoker and no smoker in visitors, and restaurant should import exhaust system for the sake of no smokerfs health.
If restaurants do these measure, I have nothing complaint.
If visitors donft want to wait, they con choose different side seat from own side. But the small shop that they arenft able to separate smoking area and no smoking area offer dishes that cooked only this shop and we canft eat except for this shop, I suffer.
In this case, visitors give way to each other about smoking is only answer.
