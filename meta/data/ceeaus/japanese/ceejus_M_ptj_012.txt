I agree with the statement, because we can learn a lot of things in working part-time. 
First, we can see how hard we survive in our society. Working every day is very hard. And we encounter a variety of difficult about working itself, human relations in the office, binding ourselves by work and so on. When we graduate from our college, we will start to work. We canÅft live without effort and difficult. 
Second, we can earn. ItÅfs no wonder, but itÅfs very important. If we had no money, we could buy nothing. It means that we canÅft have any house, any food and any clothes. We canÅft live without money. 
Lastly, we can make good human relations. We live with a lot of people and they help us or we do them. And we often have to get along with difficult people. None can live alone, so itÅfs quite important in our life.
So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have actually learned the above things in working. I want to continue working unless it gives bad effect for my everyday study.
