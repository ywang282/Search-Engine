Å@I am agreeable in this opinion. There are two reasons.
  The first is that I may smoke passively when I sit down near the person who smokes on the seat. Passive smoking is that nonsmokers who are near smokers are forced to breathe the smoke got out of the end of tobacco and expired by smokers. And these smokes contain many harmful substances such as what can cause cancer. Unfortunately because most of the nonsmoking seats were full up, I have been led to a nonsmoking seat near the smoking seats by a clerk before. Though I was eating deliciously, I had my feeling displeased by smoking smell. I think that other people as well as I are also troubled with smoking smell.
  The second is that bad smoking smell sticks to clothes when sitting down near smokers. Of course, that also does nonsmokersÅf feeling harm. The other day, when I went to a restaurant with my family, I have had my feeling displeased by smoking smell from my father. Even after we finished eating and went out of the restaurant, I have had my feeling displeased by smoking smell from my clothes again.
  From these two reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
