I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. When I say more, walk smoking should be banned everywhere. There are some reasons for my opinion. 
First, smoking harms not only smokerÅfs health but also non-smokerÅfs health. I have heard secondhand smoking is worse than smoking. In other words, it is to say that the person who does not smoke is easy to suffer from cancer. Why non-smokers are harmed by smoker? If smoker want to smoke anyway, smoker should smoke alone. I donÅft think smoker trouble non-smoker. 
Second, there are people who donÅft like smoking smell. Cigarettes smell unique. So, there are people who are made feeling bad.
Third, I think the quantity that smoker smokes will decrease by enduring to smoke after meal. A smoking rate is 50 percent at present in Japan, and smokers are pointed the badness of their manner. For example, there are walk smoking and littering cigarette. These destroy environmental. If the quantity that smoker smokes decrease and number of smoker, the quantity that walk smoker and littered cigarettes may decrease.
Problem of prohibition of smoking is difficult to solve. But this problem should be solved little by little for people and environmental.
