I disagree with the opinion. It is sure that smoke bothers those who donft like it, but you should not only support abstainers from tobacco but also stand by smokers. I think that all the restaurants should have two areas; one is the smoking area and the other is the no smoking area.
     Smoking and the smoke are thought to be harmful to you. And also actually the smoke of others is smoky and smelly to you if you arenft smoker. So you may say that if you are allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they have many demerits and donft have any merits. I donft, however, think so. If the restaurants completely ban smoking, they would get abstainersf satisfaction, but wouldnft get smokersf satisfaction and some of them would decide not to go to the restaurants.As a result, the restaurants would share only abstainers. In short, the pie would get small.
     To avoid such tragedy, the restaurants should allow smokers to smoke. If, however, they do so, abstainers would get angry instead of smokers. Then, what do the restaurants should do to gratify both of them? I have an opinion. The restaurant should make the smoker sit another to the abstainer on the area. It only has to prevent the originated smoke from reaching the no smoking seat from the smoking seat. If the group that consists of the smoker and the abstainer comes to the restaurant, they only have to decide on which seat they sit for the restaurant.
     Therefore, I am opposite to the opinion, and I think that the restaurant should have the smoking seat and the no smoking seat.
