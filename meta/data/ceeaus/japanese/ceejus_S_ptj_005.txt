 Did or will you have a part-time job when you are a college student? I think many people say ÅgYes.Åh IÅfm going to do something, too. By the way, what do you think about the question if it is important to have it? In my opinion, the answer is also ÅgYes.Åh There are three reasons.
  First, working makes you more responsible. When you high school, junior high school students, if you donÅft something to do, you are only scold. However, if you are lazy to do your tasks in working place, your coworkers or boss must be damaged. You have an only choice to be responsible.
  Second, to earn money for yourself makes you independent. It makes the people know how hard it is to earn money and how important money is. Therefore, you will think when and how spend the money more carefully than before. I think it is the first step to be independent. ItÅfs because to be independent is to do something for yourself, so
It includes the case that you buy what you want by the money you earn.
   Finally, the experience is useful when you work after graduation. Of course, having a part-time job is different from working for the company. However, you must be more responsible and independent if you have had a part-time job. The change in itself helps you. LetÅfs have a part-time job if youÅfre a college student.
