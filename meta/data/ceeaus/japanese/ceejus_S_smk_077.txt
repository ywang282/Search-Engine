
I agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are a lot of reasons that I think so. For instance, smoking is very bad for our health, it declines our physical abilities, and it costs much money. Smokers have no merit. 

Smoking has bad influence upon not only smokers but also non-smokers. For instance, the smell of smoke makes non-smokers feel bad. In fact, I hate the smell of smoke. The smoke of tobacco does not only make non-smokers feel bad but also do harm to their health. It is called secondhand smoking. It has a worse influence upon non-smokers more than smokers. It causes serious illnesses such as cancer and so on. It seems that smokers do not realize that they annoy non-smokers with their actions. 

Now campaign against smoking is being held. As a result, the number of smokers is decreased little by little. This is good trend. We should keep decreasing the number of smokers and make a situation that non-smokers can not start smoking easily. I think that even if we cannot ban smoking at all places, we have to ban smoking at all places where there are plenty of people who do not like smoking, such as restaurants and so on. I believe that such actions make a lot of people happy.
