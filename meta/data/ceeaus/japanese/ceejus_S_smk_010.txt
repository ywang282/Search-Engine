 I against that opinion because there are many people who smoke after dinner or lunch in restaurants, and they canft stop smoking. It is pity that those people canft smoke in restaurants suddenly.
     In fact, smoking is wrong for our health, and effect people who donft smoke, but I think that it is ok if smoking people separated from not smoking people thoroughly. Smoking is not good for us, but this custom has been continued for a long time, so all the people canft stop it. Besides, smoking is different from drugs. Drugs are crime, but smoking is not guilty. I hope that smoking is permitted in restaurants. By the way, I donft smoke.
