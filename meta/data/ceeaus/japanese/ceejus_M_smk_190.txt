I disagree with this statement. I have heard a good idea about this
problem.
 This idea is called ÅgBun-enÅh. This idea is that completely separating
nonsmokers and smokers. By this idea, nonsmokers donÅft absorb smoke and
smokers can smoke.
 But, this idea has a defect. Some people say that this idea is
difficult to carry out so that nonsmokers might not smoke and that
nonsmokers may absorb smoke. Of course, this is right. However, in many
restaurants, we will not absorb smoke. Why? There are walls between
nonsmokers and smokers in many restaurants. And in my opinion, smokers
have rights to smoke. So we cannot easily ban smoking in all
restaurants. But donÅft forget. Smoking is unhealthy for not only smokers
but also nonsmokers, because nonsmokers absorb smoke which smokers make.
So it is needless to say that smokers must not smoke if they are sitting
in the restaurant which cannot completely separate nonsmokers and smokers.
 Most important thing to do this idea is that everyone understand this
idea and the defect of this idea and corporate. If there are no
understanding, the restaurant owner cannot make walls. If smokers smoke
in the restaurant which separate nonsmokers and smokers but nonsmokers
can absorb smoke, some nonsmokers may say ÅgBecause we allow smokers to
smoke restaurant, we absorb smoke. So smoking should be completely
banned at all restaurants!!Åh.
 In this way, everyone have to understand this idea and the defect. If
they do this, all people will enjoy their lives.
