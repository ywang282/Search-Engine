I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan.

 

Most people in Japan have known the serious harm of smoking , such as cancer of the lungs , but in fact there are many smokers in Japan. Of course smoking is no good for our body , but for heavy smokers ,I think that life without cigarettes is nothing other than pain.

 

If smoking was banned at all the restaurant in Japan , smokers would be under great stress , because many people go to restaurants not only to eat dishes but also to take rest . Smokersf rest means ghaving a cigarettesh. 

 

 I do not smoke. And I feel irritated when Ifm in a secret room and other person in the room start to smoke. But even so , itfs not right to take smokersf rights away. 

 

 I think it is desirable to make smoking area and non smoking area more strictly at every restaurant. There are already smoking room at restaurants , but it is not enough. Smoking area and non smoking area should be separated more reliably. By doing so , smokers and non smokers will be able to go to restaurant without any reservations.
