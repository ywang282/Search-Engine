I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants
not only in Japan but also all over the world. And in the first place I
believe that tobacco do not have to be made anywhere because tobacco
contain a large number of poison only.
 Basically those who hate anyonefs smoking nearby are everywhere.
Personally I dislike smoking, too. We can decrease People are made feel
unpleasant by smoking. This can make by smokersf enduring smoking.
Smokers can endure smoking, but those donft smoke canft get smokers not
to smoke. So we need smokersf will that smokers donft cause any trouble,
if smokers want smoking not to be banned at restaurant or other public
space.
 Tobaccofs smokes have a bunch of poison.  And that someone smoke is the
fact there are many passive smoker. This seems that smoker spread some
poison. If one murders the other by poison, he must be punished. However
at least there are people who caused illness or killed by passive
smoking. Therefore I suppose that smokers have to be punished. So of
course smoking in any restaurant must be banned.
 So I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
