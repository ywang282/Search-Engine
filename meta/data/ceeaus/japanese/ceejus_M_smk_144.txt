 In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.

 One reason is that the smoke of tobacco has a bad influence not only on smokers but also on passive smokers who are near smokers. It is often said that the influence on passive smokers is heavier than the influence on smokers themselves. Smoking can do harm to passive smokers. Customers enter the restaurant not to be damaged but to enjoy having lunch or dinner.  

 Second reason is that smoking cause the restaurant to be full of smokes. The smoke goes to the dishes, and the taste of them become worse. People, particularly nonsmokers feel uncomfortable to inhale tobaccoÅfs smoke. The smell is very important to the dish. When the smell become worse, the tastes also become worse.

 Third reason is that the cost of maintenance falls down. TobaccoÅfs smoke goes to the clothes of waiters and waitresses, and the cost of wash become higher. The smoke also goes to the walls of the restaurant, and the cost of cleaning become higher in order to remove the smell of the smoke.

 That is to say, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
