A restaurant is a place where people enjoy not smoking but eating. There are many kinds of people in restaurants, families including young children for instance. If someone smokes near young children, his smoke makes their health bad without his notice.  Though, you have a right to relax with your own way, smoking gives other people much more infection than your contentment. That is why, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Even if each tables are divided into two parts, one is for smokers and the other is for non-smokers, their smoke is spread to all tables and spoils their meals. And more, the restaurant which is full of smoke looks dirty. In fact, there is a city law which bans smoking at all the restaurants in Yokohama. People who want to smoke while drinking or run bar are against this law. But I think that this law is the best way to make citizensÅfs health more good. As the place where people can smoke decrease, people who smoke also decrease. I wish that many cities should adopt such a law immediately. Then, everyone will be able to have a good time in all restaurants. So to conclude, I really believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
