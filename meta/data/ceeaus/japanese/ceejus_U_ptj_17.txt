 In Japan, many college students have a point job. They work in restaurant, convenience store, and as teachers who teach elementary, junior high school or high school students, and so on. The purposes of having such jobs differ from students, but   I think it is important for college students to have such a point job.

 

The first advantage in having a point job is that they can use money for themselves. For example, when a student wants to study abroad, she needs much money. Maybe her parents support her, but she began to say it so she should earn some money by herself to use for it. And when college students play with friends, they use more money than when they were high school students. If you donÅft have a point job and canÅft afford for money, the relation between you and your friends will worse.

  

The second advantage is that they can learn social rules and get much kind of skills. For example, if you work in restaurant, you can learn how to contact with customers and your bosses. If you work as a teacher, you can learn how to tell what you want clearly. Perhaps you discover the work you want to enter.

 
 Thus if you have a point job, you can earn money to use freely and learn your society. So I agree with college studentsÅf having point jobs.
