In these days, I heard an information of non-smoking area in Kobe is about to be enforced. The non-smoking area has been spreading all over the country. When I was in Hiroshima, that area has been enforced at main part of the city. These instances show us that public opinions are unlikely to be possible for smokers to smoke in public place. As far as I know, smoking has no good effects for the health of smokers their own and passive smokers. However, the right of choice what smoke or not belongs to smokers their own. There are not any laws that ban smoking. The restaurant is industry of the service. The service should provide for customers equally and fairly. From this point of view, the restaurant in Japan should not ban smoking completely. The fact of matter is that almost all of restaurantÅfs staff in Japan asks customers this sentence ÅgWhich do you want to sit, smoking or non-smoking?Åh and lead them to smoking seat or non-smoking seat. This is a good idea separate customers. The matter of smoking is solved by not only the restaurant but also smokers. So, smokerÅfs moral is responsible for the matter of smoking especially at public place. This is why the restaurant needs not ban smoking completely.
