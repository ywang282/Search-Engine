I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.

Smoking has good points and also bad points.
Of course, you can get a pleasure, and have a relax when you smoke. I donÅft know how I feel when I smoke, because I donÅft smoke.
However, at the same time, you get harm your lung and people next to you. When a non-smoker breath smoke, he get harm more seriously than smoker breath smoke. You damage other people unconsciously.
If you are in your house, you can smoke without any anxiety. But if you are in a restaurant, you should not have a smoke because there are many people around you.

Someone may say it is a pity for smokers that smoking is banned at all restaurants in Japan. 
Of course, today, smoking is banned at many places. For example, you must not smoke at many stations, department stores, buildings. If all restaurants become banned places for smoking, smokers canÅft get a pleasure by smoking in Japan.
However, you should not harm other people by smoking. If someone dead because you smoke, how you take the responsibility of his death?

Therefore smokers should go out from a restaurant if you want to smoke, or find other ways how get a pleasure.
