"I agree to have a part-time job by college students.

Firstly, it is important for college students to earn money by
themselves. If they worked , they were realized that money is valuable.

Secondly, they can know the real society. And, this experience is sure
to help your working in the company.

Finally there are many people and they are several ages. So you speak
senior people or younger people and you can know the way to respect
older people. To be sure , you careful of your phrase. These experiences
are inevitable for us to survive.

Indeed part-time job spare they their time and they can not study hard.
I also think that college studentÅfs work is studying.

But it is more important for human to enjoy with friends than only
studying.

In case of friends is including colleague. Nowadays, most young people
hardly communicate their opinion for other people. Because they spend
all of time in their home. I strongly suggest that to go to anywhere and
to speak many people.

So I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.
