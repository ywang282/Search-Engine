I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan.  There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking. 
First, smoking does harm smokerÅfs health. So, smokers become to dislike exercising and they are apt to be illness. For example, smoking do harm smokerÅfs lung. And the function of lung becomes not to work normally. They sometimes die of lung cancer. 
Second, smoking does harm not only smokers but also non-smokers. In fact, Passive smoking is sometimes more harmful than smoking. I think that it doesnÅft pay for non-smoker. But some smokers stupidly smoke regardless of the presence of the non-smokers. Now many people and pets worry about to the danger of the passive smoking. So smoking makes no benefit to all creatures! 
Lastly, people recently think that smoking is a kind of shameful act in formal or public place. I have even heard that smokers canÅft promote in a certain big corporation. In fact, non-smoking areas are increasing now. For instance, there are completely non-smoking areas in platforms, coffee shop and beach. In America, smoking is completely banned at almost all the restaurant.
Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan. I think that it is the most important thing to feel of others for smoking.
