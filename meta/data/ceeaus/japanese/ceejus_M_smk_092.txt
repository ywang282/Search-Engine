I agree this opinion. I am not a smoker. So I donÅft like smell of smoking.
When I am eating something, if someone near me is smoking, I become
unpleasant. And I turn irritated. Finally, I come to be able to eat few
dishes and I will not order dishes any more.
Other people should have experienced this situation like me. Recently
nonsmoker is increasing. So, if the restaurant doesn
Åft ban smoking, many people lose appetite and the number of orders will
decrease !! At last, the restaurant will be out of business.

And as you know, smoking will harm peopleÅfs health. Only take the smoke
which drift from other
Åfs tobacco, there is a possibility of cancer. I donÅft want to become
disease because of other
Åfs careless.
Surely people who have a habit to smoke may be relaxed by tobacco. When
they feel stressed, smoking may release from the nervousness. And there may
be many people who look forward to smoke soon after dinner. So they must be
hard to put up with smoking at restaurant.
But things are changing. The age which people can smoke everywhere and
every time is over. So we have to obey social rules. Don
Åft to annoy people around us by smoking. To live comfortably for everyone,
only at restaurant, smoker should put up with smoking.
