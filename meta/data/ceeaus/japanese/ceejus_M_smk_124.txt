I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan. There are some reasons.

First of all, I hate smoking, so I want smoking to be forbidden.

Second, if someone smokes in the restaurant, the smoke will make non-smokers feel unpleasant. Some restaurants have some provision against smoker. For instance, smokers are separated from non-smokers in some restaurants, but a man who wants to smoke should get out from the restaurant.

Third, smoking is bad for health to not only smokers but also non-smokers. To make matters worse, the smoke non-smokers suck is worse than the smoke smokers suck. A man who lives with a smoker is liable to be disease. For instance, if you live with a smoker, the rate you get cancer will increase, and living with a smoker increase mortality among non-smokers. Moreover, the influence on children and the pregnant is   larger.

Such being the case, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Japan.
