Recently, some local governments ban on smoking on street. Smokers are
against this new regulation. But many no-smokers think that smokers
should be prohibited smoking in any other public places. Especially,
they should be forbidden to smoking in restaurant by regulations. I
agree with this idea and I have three opinions about this topic.
First, it is widely known, the cigarette smoke has many various harmful
materials for example nicotine, carbon monoxide, tar and so on. It
damages not only smokers but also people around them. This smoke gives
more harm to children than adults. If you smoke around children, you
look like to injure them lungs slowly by knife.Secondly, restaurant is
place where many people enjoy dishes. But smoke has too bad smell.
People in restaurant that filled by smoke can not relax and taste dishes
correctly. All restaurant chefs donÅft want to enter smokers in them
restaurant. Finally, according to some newspaper research, more than a
one fourth smoker wants to give up smoking but can not. They also say
that they will be able to give up if the rules of smoking changes
stricter. Strict rules are chance for smokers to change them life style
healthier.
