I agree with the statement: It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons about this.
First, a part-time job gives me relationships with different people. In fact, I made a best friend at my part-time job. And there are people of all ages. I enjoy talking with my senior. I can get many ways of thinking. College students will rarely have a chance to meet many people of all ages at only the college.
Second, I can learn not only content of the job but also the basic manner. I think itÅfs very necessary. This manner what I learned in my job will be useful in future. For example, I learned honorific, service for customers, and so on. These are very difficult, but IÅfm happy to learn it now. I think that a part-time job is the first step for going out into the world.
Third, I could thank my parents. I learned that job is very hard and that money is important. If I didnÅft have a part-time job, I would not have noticed that. Now IÅfm using the money with thinking well. 
 These are my main reasons. I think that we should have a part-time job, so I want to go on with my part-time job. And I want to learn many things.
ThatÅfs all. Thank you for reading.
