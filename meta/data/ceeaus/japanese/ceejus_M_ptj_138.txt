"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time
job, because by doing so, they can get a various of experiences.
 Some people may say that to have a part-time job interrupts to study
for college students and in addition, working as part-time jobber lets
college students have the view that working is only the mean to earn
money, and they come not to contribute to the society, like doing
volunteer. Moreover, as there are many other enjoyable things in the
college, just doing part-time job not others is so waste for them.
 However, I donÅft think so. The reason is that to have a part-time job
doesnÅft necessary prevent college students from studying or other
activities, because having only to plan efficiently, even if they work,
they have enough time to study. They may do a high performance, rather,
by living a busy and planned life. Furthermore, as I said first, having
a part-time job gives them rich experiences. For example, by doing
part-time job, they get a chance to meet a lot of people, and working in
the school days makes them know how to behave in the society like a
follow thing ; when people talk with their boss, they must talk
respecting him. In this way, I strongly think to have a part-time job is
very profitable for college students"
