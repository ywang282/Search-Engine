I agree this statement. I have three reasons. First, Cigarette is a kind
of drug for smoker. It includes ÅgNicotineÅh and this has poison. If you
smoke 40,50 cigarettes every day for 20,30 years, you will probably
become diseases of lung. So not-smoker should not smoke and smoker
should stop smoking as early as they can. In this point of view, this
opinion will be useful for smoker to start to stop smoking and to send a
healthy life. Second, Smoking is not healthy for surrounding person too.
This is because the smoke which smoker blow out has strong poison. A
restaurant is the place where a lot of people are, and some smoker comes
there with his family. So smokers should not smoke there for  the others
and their family in order not to bless the smoke. Certainly, there is an
argument that separating smoker and not-smoker solves this problem, but
it is almost impossible to separate them completely. People who are
around border can be made to keep blessing the smoke. Finally, because
recently people who understand an effect of cigarette and stop smoking
are increasing, this idea is not ideal. It may be achieved sooner than
you expect.
