    I agree with this statement. We should not smoke at restaurant.
There are three reasons that make me think so.
    First, smoking is nuisance to around people. They comes restaurant
to enjoy their meals, its taste and its smell. However, if there is a
smoker by them, their meals are spoiled by smoke of his cigarette. In
fact, in the restaurant where I do a part-time job, a woman asked me for
 change her table to where is far from the smoker. If I had not changed
her table, she would not have been satisfied when she finished her meal.
    Second, smoking spoils his own sense of taste. Surely he also comes
restaurant to enjoy his meals, its taste and its smell. But, he takes
his own pleasure by smoking. He puts taste of cigarette he can enjoy
everywhere on special taste of meals he can enjoy in only that
restaurant. There is not more wasteful than this story.
    Third, smoking obstructs nutrition. As if he ate something healthy,
he could not take its nutrition in his body. This is wasteful story too.
    Because of above three reasons, I think that we should not smoke at
restaurant and smoking should be completely banned at restaurant.
