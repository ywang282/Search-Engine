I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
We can learn many things from having a part-time job. In my case, it is very good experience that I can meet many people and talk to have a part-time job. They tell me many things not only the job with talking with them. For example I learn what I should do while I am in the university to get a job I hope from talking with a person who works at the same work place. And I can change my bad character a little. I used to be not good at talk to other people. But I steadily can do it since I started to work at the workplace. I also learn to earn money is very hard. And I become not to use much money.
But, if you have something to want to do, or have to do, you donÅft have to have a part-time job. If you donÅft have any clear vision for future and canÅft find what you should do, have a part-time job and talk with many people. Maybe there is any hint. I could find hint how I spent time while I am in the university.
