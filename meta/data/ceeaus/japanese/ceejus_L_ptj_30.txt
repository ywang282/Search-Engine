"I agree with this idea.
Now, I take some reasons.
First, college students are going to work somewhere. And they will work
full time. Full time job is very hard and tough. They have to experience
some part time job to get over this. If they experience part time job,
they will increase efficiency. And because they can experience various
jobs, they can find what job goes with them. And they can find out some
goals. Goals are very important for college students.
Second, I think that college students had better earn the cost of living
and school fees as much as they can. The reason I say so is that college
students could choose the way to study or to work. But they choose to
study and task their parents. So I think they lead a life by themselves
as much as possible.
Third, they can learn importance of money by working part time job.
Therefore they reflect how they use some money. And they think what they
want to buy is what they really need. So they will not buy what they do
not need really.
So I think that it is important for college students to have a part time
job.
