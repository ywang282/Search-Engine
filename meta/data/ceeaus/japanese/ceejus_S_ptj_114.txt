I agree with this opinion. I have three ideas.
 First, college students have to lern how hard to earn money is. In order
to make money,  you have to smile  even when you don
Åft feel good, you have to obey  your manager even if you donÅft like him
or her.It is not so easy to earn money, but by knowing it, you can lern how
important money is. If you guraduate from college without knowing it, you
may spend hard time when you get job.
 Second, you can be known with a lot of people. By having a part-time job,
you can communicate with a lot of people. Some people go to other colleges
and other people don
Åft go to college and have been working for a long time. You can lern so
many things from these peple. 
 Finally, by doing part-time job, you can enjoy college life more. You can
Åft date with your boy friend or girl frend , you canÅft hang out with your
friends on weekend if you don
Åft have money.If you work at part-time job harder, your can get money and
you can enjoy dineer with your lover or drinking with your friends.
Ofcourse, it is very important to study when you go to college, but these
things are also important for college students. It
Åfs because you will be busy in working and you wonÅft have enogh time to
do these things after graduation.
 So, to make your college life better, you should do part-time job and make
money.
